    "# BIR retrieval with inverted files\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin by setting up a straightforward scenario involving a handful of terms and assigning random document references to them. Our focus here is to demonstrate the use of inverted files for Boolean retrieval. We will explore two aspects: 1) employing set operators for query evaluation, and 2) utilizing streaming interfaces to efficiently retrieve postings. It's important to note that in this scenario, we are using document IDs instead of actual documents to keep things simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create inverted index\n",
    "The next section generates random inverted index postings for a set of terms. It simulates the indexing process for Boolean retrieval by associating random document IDs with each term. The `vocabulary` dictionary defines terms and their desired document frequencies (as a %-figure). The generated postings are stored in the `index` dictionary, with each term mapped to a set of corresponding document IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `nDocs = 100`: Defines the total number of documents (document IDs) as 100.\n",
    "* `index = {}`: Initializes an empty dictionary to store the postings for each term.\n",
    "* `DEBUG = False`: A debug flag (we use it later to illustrate code execution).\n",
    "* `vocabulary`: Defines a dictionary where each term is associated with its desired document frequency (expressed as a percentage).\n",
    "\n",
    "`createPostings(term: str, docFreq: int = None)` takes a term (string) and an optional document frequency (docFreq, integer) as arguments. It generates random postings for the term by creating a set of document IDs. If docFreq is not provided, it generates a random document frequency between 1 and nDocs. The for-loop iterates through each term in the vocabulary dictionary and calls the createPostings function. For each term, it fetches the desired document frequency from the vocabulary (values are percentages) and passes it to createPostings."

Preventing duplicate file reads demands additional buffering logic. Furthermore, for data efficiency, it's advisable to apply compression techniques to reduce the data volume."
