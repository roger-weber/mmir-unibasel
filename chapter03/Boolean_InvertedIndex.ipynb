    "# Boolean retrieval with inverted files\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin by setting up a straightforward scenario involving a handful of terms and assigning random document references to them. Our focus here is to demonstrate the use of inverted files for Boolean retrieval. We will explore two aspects: 1) employing set operators for query evaluation, and 2) utilizing streaming interfaces to efficiently retrieve postings. It's important to note that in this scenario, we are using document IDs instead of actual documents to keep things simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create inverted index\n",
    "The next section generates random inverted index postings for a set of terms. It simulates the indexing process for Boolean retrieval by associating random document IDs with each term. The `vocabulary` dictionary defines terms and their desired document frequencies (as a %-figure). The generated postings are stored in the `index` dictionary, with each term mapped to a set of corresponding document IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `nDocs = 100`: Defines the total number of documents (document IDs) as 100.\n",
    "* `index = {}`: Initializes an empty dictionary to store the postings for each term.\n",
    "* `DEBUG = False`: A debug flag (we use it later to illustrate code execution).\n",
    "* `vocabulary`: Defines a dictionary where each term is associated with its desired document frequency (expressed as a percentage).\n",
    "\n",
    "`createPostings(term: str, docFreq: int = None)` takes a term (string) and an optional document frequency (docFreq, integer) as arguments. It generates random postings for the term by creating a set of document IDs. If docFreq is not provided, it generates a random document frequency between 1 and nDocs. The for-loop iterates through each term in the vocabulary dictionary and calls the createPostings function. For each term, it fetches the desired document frequency from the vocabulary (values are percentages) and passes it to createPostings."

    "The set-based evaluation from above does not scale well with the number of documents. In cases with millions of billions of postings for a term, we want to fetch data from an external storage device (which is also a good idea for peristence). But instead of reading all postings into main memory, we read them as streams sorted by the document IDs. Take the postings of cat and dog as an example:\n",

    "| cat | `[1, 4, 8, 10]` |\n",

    "\n",
    "To evaluate a query like \"cat AND dog\", we fetch the first entry for each term, that is `1` for cat and `3` for dog. If they are the same, we know that the corresponding document fulfills the predicate. If not, then we read the next entry for the term currently having the smallest doc ID. In our example, we read the next cat posting which is `4`. Again, we have no match, so we progress now postings of dog as it currently has the smallest value. The next psoting for dog is `4`which matches with the one of cat; hence, we found our first document and return it (in Python we use generators with `yield` as we also do not want to return all results at once but in batches as the user browses through pages). If we need more results to return, we now fetch the next posting for both terms and repeat. Finally, we find `10` and return it as a secon answer. If we need more results, we again fetch the next posting for both terms. But since cat does not have more postings, we can terminate the evaluation and stop iteration (dog still has `12` but we already know from the empty cat postings that it cannot match the query). The following visualizes the approach:\n",

    "| 6 | - | `12` | stop iteration as all cat postings are visited; remaining postings in dog cannot fulfill predicate |\n",
    "\n",
    "The OR-operator is implemented similarly, but the iteration returns every time the smallest entry from a sub-expression. For the example above, the OR-operator would first return `1`, progress cat, return `3`, progress dog, return `4`, progress both cat and dog, return `8`, progress cat, return `10`, progress both cat and dog, and finally return `12`. The evaluation stops when all postings are consumed.\n",
