    "To evaluate a query like \"cat AND dog\", we fetch the first entry for each term, that is `1` for cat and `3` for dog. If they are the same, we know that the corresponding document fulfills the predicate. If not, then we read the next entry for the term currently having the smallest doc ID. In our example, we read the next cat posting which is `4`. Again, we have no match, so we progress now postings of dog as it currently has the smallest value. The next posting for dog is `4`which matches with the one of cat; hence, we found our first document and return it (in Python we use generators with `yield` as we also do not want to return all results at once but in batches as the user browses through pages). If we need more results to return, we now fetch the next posting for both terms and repeat. Finally, we find `10` and return it as a second answer. If we need more results, we again fetch the next posting for both terms. But since cat does not have more postings, we can terminate the evaluation and stop iteration (dog still has `12` but we already know from the empty cat postings that it cannot match the query). The following visualizes the approach:\n",

    "|step|cat (next) |dog (next) | action|\n",
    "|:-- |:-- |:-- |:-- |\n",
    "| 1 | `1` | `3` | no match, progress cat |\n",
    "| 2 | `4` | `3` | no match, progress dog |\n",
    "| 3 | `4` | `4` | match, return `4` as result, wait to provide next result, and progress both cat and dog |\n",
    "| 4 | `8` | `10` | no match, progress cat |\n",
    "| 5 | `10` | `10` | match, return `10` as result, wait to provide next result, and progress both cat and dog |\n",
    "| 6 | - | `12` | stop iteration as all cat postings are visited; remaining postings in dog cannot fulfill predicate |\n",
    "\n",
    "The OR-operator is implemented similarly, but the iteration returns every time the smallest entry from a sub-expression. For the example above, the OR-operator would first return `1`, progress cat, return `3`, progress dog, return `4`, progress both cat and dog, return `8`, progress cat, return `10`, progress both cat and dog, and finally return `12`. The evaluation stops when all postings are consumed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"cat AND NOT(dog)\" evaluation progress is the same as with the AND flow but results are different (match if cat != dog):\n",

Preventing duplicate file reads demands additional buffering logic. Furthermore, for data efficiency, it's advisable to apply compression techniques to reduce the data volume."
