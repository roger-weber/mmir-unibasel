    "## 2nd Implementation: using stream based evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "The set-based evaluation from above does not scale well with the number of documents. In cases with millions of billions of postings for a term, we want to fetch data from an external storage device (which is also a good idea for persistence). But instead of reading all postings into main memory, we read them as streams sorted by the document IDs. Take the postings of cat and dog as an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "| term | postings|\n",
    "| :-- | :-- |\n",
    "| cat | `[1, 4, 8, 10]` |\n",
    "| dog | `[3, 4, 10, 12]` |\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate a query like \"cat AND dog\", we fetch the first entry for each term, that is `1` for cat and `3` for dog. If they are the same, we know that the corresponding document fulfills the predicate. If not, then we read the next entry for the term currently having the smallest doc ID. In our example, we read the next cat posting which is `4`. Again, we have no match, so we progress now postings of dog as it currently has the smallest value. The next posting for dog is `4` which matches with the one of cat; hence, we found our first document and return it (in Python we use generators with `yield` as we also do not want to return all results at once but in batches as the user browses through pages). If we need more results to return, we now fetch the next posting for both terms and repeat. Finally, we find `10` and return it as a second answer. If we need more results, we again fetch the next posting for both terms. But since cat does not have more postings, we can terminate the evaluation and stop iteration (dog still has `12` but we already know from the empty cat postings that it cannot match the query). The following visualizes the approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "|step|cat (next) |dog (next) | action|\n",
    "|:-- |:-- |:-- |:-- |\n",
    "| 1 | `1` | `3` | no match, progress cat |\n",
    "| 2 | `4` | `3` | no match, progress dog |\n",
    "| 3 | `4` | `4` | match, return `4` as result, wait to provide next result, and progress both cat and dog |\n",
    "| 4 | `8` | `10` | no match, progress cat |\n",
    "| 5 | `10` | `10` | match, return `10` as result, wait to provide next result, and progress both cat and dog |\n",
    "| 6 | - | `12` | stop iteration as all cat postings are visited; remaining postings in dog cannot fulfill predicate |\n",
    "\n",
    "The OR-operator is implemented similarly, but the iteration returns every time the smallest entry from a sub-expression.

    "Next, we build a representation for Boolean expressions that allows us to retrieve arbitrary queries with the stream based evaluation scheme introduced above. Each object in the representation relates to a sub-expression in the query that is evaluated in a stream-based manner. By composition, we can aggregate atomic queries over terms to arbitrarily complex Boolean queries. We introduce a class ``Term`` to denote atomic queries, 2 classes ``And`` and ``Or`` that represent the boolean operators with an arbitrary number of operands (which can be of type ``Term``, ``And``, and ``Or``). Finally, we also define a class ``Not`` that acts on a single sub-expression (again of any sub-type). However, we do not allow nesting of ``Not``, and only ``And`` expression can have a sub-expression with ``Not`` (and must have at leas one subexpression without ``Not``). Our implentation of ``Not`` is to mark sub-expression, but the class has no way to evaluate itself."

    "#### Atomic term expressions\n",
    "This class implements a retriever for an atomic term query; it is intentionally kept basic for illustrative purposes. It doesn't involve file reading; rather, it relies on the query parser to pass the postings for the terms. If needed, we can effortlessly replace the for-loop with file reading operations. However, this change introduces complexities because terms may appear multiple times in a Boolean query (e.g., \"cat AND dog OR cat AND horse\"). Preventing duplicate file reads demands additional buffering logic. Furthermore, for data efficiency, it's advisable to apply compression techniques to reduce the data volume."
