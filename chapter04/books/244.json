SHERLOCK HOLMES.\n\n\nIn the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the\nUniversity of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course\nprescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there,\nI was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant\nSurgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before I\ncould join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at\nBombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and\nwas already deep in the enemy\u2019s country. I followed, however, with many\nother officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded\nin reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once\nentered upon my new duties.\n\nThe campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had\nnothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and\nattached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of\nMaiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which\nshattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should have\nfallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the\ndevotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a\npack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.\n\nWorn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had\nundergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to\nthe base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improved\nso far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little\nupon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse\nof our Indian possessions. For months my life was despaired of, and\nwhen at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak\nand emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be\nlost in sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in\nthe troopship \u201cOrontes,\u201d and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty,\nwith my health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a\npaternal government to spend the next nine months in attempting to\nimprove it.\n\nI had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as\nair\u2014or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will\npermit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to\nLondon, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of\nthe Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time at a\nprivate hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless\nexistence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely\nthan I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances become, that I\nsoon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate\nsomewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in\nmy style of living. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making\nup my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less\npretentious and less expensive domicile.\n\nOn the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at\nthe Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning\nround I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at\nBarts. The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London\nis a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In old days Stamford had\nnever been a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with\nenthusiasm, and he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me. In\nthe exuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn,\nand we started off together in a hansom.\n\n\u201cWhatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?\u201d he asked in\nundisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets.\n\u201cYou are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.\u201d\n\nI gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded it\nby the time that we reached our destination.\n\n\u201cPoor devil!\u201d he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my\nmisfortunes. \u201cWhat are you up to now?\u201d\n\n\u201cLooking for lodgings,\u201d I answered. \u201cTrying to solve the problem as to\nwhether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable price.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a strange thing,\u201d remarked my companion; \u201cyou are the second\nman to-day that has used that expression to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd who was the first?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cA fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital.\nHe was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone\nto go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found, and which\nwere too much for his purse.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy Jove!\u201d I cried, \u201cif he really wants someone to share the rooms and\nthe expense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a\npartner to being alone.\u201d\n\nYoung Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass. \u201cYou\ndon\u2019t know Sherlock Holmes yet,\u201d he said; \u201cperhaps you would not care\nfor him as a constant companion.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, what is there against him?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t say there was anything against him. He is a little queer\nin his ideas\u2014an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as I\nknow he is a decent fellow enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cA medical student, I suppose?\u201d said I.\n\n\u201cNo\u2014I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is well\nup in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I know,\nhe has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His studies are\nvery desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the\nway knowledge which would astonish his professors.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you never ask him what he was going in for?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNo; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be\ncommunicative enough when the fancy seizes him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI should like to meet him,\u201d I said. \u201cIf I am to lodge with anyone, I\nshould prefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strong\nenough yet to stand much noise or excitement. I had enough of both in\nAfghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence. How\ncould I meet this friend of yours?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is sure to be at the laboratory,\u201d returned my companion. \u201cHe either\navoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from morning to\nnight. If you like, we shall drive round together after luncheon.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other\nchannels.\n\nAs we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn, Stamford\ngave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to\ntake as a fellow-lodger.\n\n\u201cYou mustn\u2019t blame me if you don\u2019t get on with him,\u201d he said; \u201cI know\nnothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally\nin the laboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold\nme responsible.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t get on it will be easy to part company,\u201d I answered. \u201cIt\nseems to me, Stamford,\u201d I added, looking hard at my companion, \u201cthat\nyou have some reason for washing your hands of the matter. Is this\nfellow\u2019s temper so formidable, or what is it? Don\u2019t be mealy-mouthed\nabout it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not easy to express the inexpressible,\u201d he answered with a\nlaugh. \u201cHolmes is a little too scientific for my tastes\u2014it approaches\nto cold-bloodedness. I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch\nof the latest vegetable alkaloid, not out of malevolence, you\nunderstand, but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an\naccurate idea of the effects. To do him justice, I think that he would\ntake it himself with the same readiness. He appears to have a passion\nfor definite and exact knowledge.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery right too.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but it may be pushed to excess. When it comes to beating the\nsubjects in the dissecting-rooms with a stick, it is certainly taking\nrather a bizarre shape.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeating the subjects!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, to verify how far bruises may be produced after death. I saw him\nat it with my own eyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yet you say he is not a medical student?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. Heaven knows what the objects of his studies are. But here we are,\nand you must form your own impressions about him.\u201d As he spoke, we\nturned down a narrow lane and passed through a small side-door, which\nopened into a wing of the great hospital. It was familiar ground to me,\nand I needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone staircase and\nmade our way down the long corridor with its vista of whitewashed wall\nand dun-coloured doors. Near the further end a low arched passage\nbranched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory.\n\nThis was a lofty chamber, lined and littered with countless bottles.\nBroad, low tables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts,\ntest-tubes, and little Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering flames.\nThere was only one student in the room, who was bending over a distant\ntable absorbed in his work. At the sound of our steps he glanced round\nand sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure. \u201cI\u2019ve found it! I\u2019ve\nfound it,\u201d he shouted to my companion, running towards us with a\ntest-tube in his hand. \u201cI have found a re-agent which is precipitated\nby h\u00e6moglobin, and by nothing else.\u201d Had he discovered a gold mine,\ngreater delight could not have shone upon his features.\n\n\u201cDr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\u201d said Stamford, introducing us.\n\n\u201cHow are you?\u201d he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength for\nwhich I should hardly have given him credit. \u201cYou have been in\nAfghanistan, I perceive.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow on earth did you know that?\u201d I asked in astonishment.\n\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d said he, chuckling to himself. \u201cThe question now is about\nh\u00e6moglobin. No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of\nmine?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is interesting, chemically, no doubt,\u201d I answered, \u201cbut\npractically\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, man, it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years.\nDon\u2019t you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains.\nCome over here now!\u201d He seized me by the coat-sleeve in his eagerness,\nand drew me over to the table at which he had been working. \u201cLet us\nhave some fresh blood,\u201d he said, digging a long bodkin into his finger,\nand drawing off the resulting drop of blood in a chemical pipette.\n\u201cNow, I add this small quantity of blood to a litre of water. You\nperceive that the resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water.\nThe proportion of blood cannot be more than one in a million. I have no\ndoubt, however, that we shall be able to obtain the characteristic\nreaction.\u201d As he spoke, he threw into the vessel a few white crystals,\nand then added some drops of a transparent fluid. In an instant the\ncontents assumed a dull mahogany colour, and a brownish dust was\nprecipitated to the bottom of the glass jar.\n\n\u201cHa! ha!\u201d he cried, clapping his hands, and looking as delighted as a\nchild with a new toy. \u201cWhat do you think of that?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems to be a very delicate test,\u201d I remarked.\n\n\u201cBeautiful! beautiful! The old Guiacum test was very clumsy and\nuncertain. So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles. The\nlatter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old. Now, this\nappears to act as well whether the blood is old or new. Had this test\nbeen invented, there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who\nwould long ago have paid the penalty of their crimes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed!\u201d I murmured.\n\n\u201cCriminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. A man is\nsuspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed. His\nlinen or clothes are examined, and brownish stains discovered upon\nthem. Are they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit\nstains, or what are they? That is a question which has puzzled many an\nexpert, and why? Because there was no reliable test. Now we have the\nSherlock Holmes\u2019 test, and there will no longer be any difficulty.\u201d\n\nHis eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his\nheart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his\nimagination.\n\n\u201cYou are to be congratulated,\u201d I remarked, considerably surprised at\nhis enthusiasm.\n\n\u201cThere was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year. He would\ncertainly have been hung had this test been in existence. Then there\nwas Mason of Bradford, and the notorious Muller, and Lefevre of\nMontpellier, and Samson of New Orleans. I could name a score of cases\nin which it would have been decisive.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou seem to be a walking calendar of crime,\u201d said Stamford with a\nlaugh. \u201cYou might start a paper on those lines. Call it the \u2018Police\nNews of the Past.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cVery interesting reading it might be made, too,\u201d remarked Sherlock\nHolmes, sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger.\n\u201cI have to be careful,\u201d he continued, turning to me with a smile, \u201cfor\nI dabble with poisons a good deal.\u201d He held out his hand as he spoke,\nand I noticed that it was all mottled over with similar pieces of\nplaster, and discoloured with strong acids.\n\n\u201cWe came here on business,\u201d said Stamford, sitting down on a high\nthree-legged stool, and pushing another one in my direction with his\nfoot. \u201cMy friend here wants to take diggings, and as you were\ncomplaining that you could get no one to go halves with you, I thought\nthat I had better bring you together.\u201d\n\nSherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms with\nme. \u201cI have my eye on a suite in Baker Street,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich would\nsuit us down to the ground. You don\u2019t mind the smell of strong tobacco,\nI hope?\u201d\n\n\u201cI always smoke \u2018ship\u2019s\u2019 myself,\u201d I answered.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s good enough. I generally have chemicals about, and occasionally\ndo experiments. Would that annoy you?\u201d\n\n\u201cBy no means.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me see\u2014what are my other shortcomings. I get in the dumps at\ntimes, and don\u2019t open my mouth for days on end. You must not think I am\nsulky when I do that. Just let me alone, and I\u2019ll soon be right. What\nhave you to confess now? It\u2019s just as well for two fellows to know the\nworst of one another before they begin to live together.\u201d\n\nI laughed at this cross-examination. \u201cI keep a bull pup,\u201d I said, \u201cand\nI object to rows because my nerves are shaken, and I get up at all\nsorts of ungodly hours, and I am extremely lazy. I have another set of\nvices when I\u2019m well, but those are the principal ones at present.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you include violin-playing in your category of rows?\u201d he asked,\nanxiously.\n\n\u201cIt depends on the player,\u201d I answered. \u201cA well-played violin is a\ntreat for the gods\u2014a badly-played one\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s all right,\u201d he cried, with a merry laugh. \u201cI think we may\nconsider the thing as settled\u2014that is, if the rooms are agreeable to\nyou.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen shall we see them?\u201d\n\n\u201cCall for me here at noon to-morrow, and we\u2019ll go together and settle\neverything,\u201d he answered.\n\n\u201cAll right\u2014noon exactly,\u201d said I, shaking his hand.\n\nWe left him working among his chemicals, and we walked together towards\nmy hotel.\n\n\u201cBy the way,\u201d I asked suddenly, stopping and turning upon Stamford,\n\u201chow the deuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan?\u201d\n\nMy companion smiled an enigmatical smile. \u201cThat\u2019s just his little\npeculiarity,\u201d he said. \u201cA good many people have wanted to know how he\nfinds things out.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! a mystery is it?\u201d I cried, rubbing my hands. \u201cThis is very\npiquant. I am much obliged to you for bringing us together. \u2018The proper\nstudy of mankind is man,\u2019 you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou must study him, then,\u201d Stamford said, as he bade me good-bye.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll find him a knotty problem, though. I\u2019ll wager he learns more\nabout you than you about him. Good-bye.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood-bye,\u201d I answered, and strolled on to my hotel, considerably\ninterested in my new acquaintance.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\nTHE SCIENCE OF DEDUCTION.\n\n\nWe met next day as he had arranged, and inspected the rooms at No.\n221B, Baker Street, of which he had spoken at our meeting. They\nconsisted of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single large airy\nsitting-room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad\nwindows. So desirable in every way were the apartments, and so moderate\ndid the terms seem when divided between us, that the bargain was\nconcluded upon the spot, and we at once entered into possession. That\nvery evening I moved my things round from the hotel, and on the\nfollowing morning Sherlock Holmes followed me with several boxes and\nportmanteaus. For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and\nlaying out our property to the best advantage. That done, we gradually\nbegan to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new\nsurroundings.\n\nHolmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet in\nhis ways, and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to be up\nafter ten at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out\nbefore I rose in the morning. Sometimes he spent his day at the\nchemical laboratory, sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and\noccasionally in long walks, which appeared to take him into the lowest\nportions of the City. Nothing could exceed his energy when the working\nfit was upon him; but now and again a reaction would seize him, and for\ndays on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, hardly\nuttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night. On these\noccasions I have noticed such a dreamy, vacant expression in his eyes,\nthat I might have suspected him of being addicted to the use of some\nnarcotic, had not the temperance and cleanliness of his whole life\nforbidden such a notion.\n\nAs the weeks went by, my interest in him and my curiosity as to his\naims in life, gradually deepened and increased. His very person and\nappearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual\nobserver. In height he was rather over six feet, and so excessively\nlean that he seemed to be considerably taller. His eyes were sharp and\npiercing, save during those intervals of torpor to which I have\nalluded; and his thin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an air\nof alertness and decision. His chin, too, had the prominence and\nsquareness which mark the man of determination. His hands were\ninvariably blotted with ink and stained with chemicals, yet he was\npossessed of extraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had\noccasion to observe when I watched him manipulating his fragile\nphilosophical instruments.\n\nThe reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody, when I confess how\nmuch this man stimulated my curiosity, and how often I endeavoured to\nbreak through the reticence which he showed on all that concerned\nhimself. Before pronouncing judgment, however, be it remembered, how\nobjectless was my life, and how little there was to engage my\nattention. My health forbade me from venturing out unless the weather\nwas exceptionally genial, and I had no friends who would call upon me\nand break the monotony of my daily existence. Under these\ncircumstances, I eagerly hailed the little mystery which hung around my\ncompanion, and spent much of my time in endeavouring to unravel it.\n\nHe was not studying medicine. He had himself, in reply to a question,\nconfirmed Stamford\u2019s opinion upon that point. Neither did he appear to\nhave pursued any course of reading which might fit him for a degree in\nscience or any other recognized portal which would give him an entrance\ninto the learned world. Yet his zeal for certain studies was\nremarkable, and within eccentric limits his knowledge was so\nextraordinarily ample and minute that his observations have fairly\nastounded me. Surely no man would work so hard or attain such precise\ninformation unless he had some definite end in view. Desultory readers\nare seldom remarkable for the exactness of their learning. No man\nburdens his mind with small matters unless he has some very good reason\nfor doing so.\n\nHis ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge. Of contemporary\nliterature, philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to\nnothing. Upon my quoting Thomas Carlyle, he inquired in the naivest way\nwho he might be and what he had done. My surprise reached a climax,\nhowever, when I found incidentally that he was ignorant of the\nCopernican Theory and of the composition of the Solar System. That any\ncivilized human being in this nineteenth century should not be aware\nthat the earth travelled round the sun appeared to be to me such an\nextraordinary fact that I could hardly realize it.\n\n\u201cYou appear to be astonished,\u201d he said, smiling at my expression of\nsurprise. \u201cNow that I do know it I shall do my best to forget it.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo forget it!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou see,\u201d he explained, \u201cI consider that a man\u2019s brain originally is\nlike a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture\nas you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he\ncomes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets\ncrowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so\nthat he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skilful\nworkman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his\nbrain-attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in\ndoing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the\nmost perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has\nelastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes\na time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that\nyou knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to\nhave useless facts elbowing out the useful ones.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the Solar System!\u201d I protested.\n\n\u201cWhat the deuce is it to me?\u201d he interrupted impatiently; \u201cyou say that\nwe go round the sun. If we went round the moon it would not make a\npennyworth of difference to me or to my work.\u201d\n\nI was on the point of asking him what that work might be, but something\nin his manner showed me that the question would be an unwelcome one. I\npondered over our short conversation, however, and endeavoured to draw\nmy deductions from it. He said that he would acquire no knowledge which\ndid not bear upon his object. Therefore all the knowledge which he\npossessed was such as would be useful to him. I enumerated in my own\nmind all the various points upon which he had shown me that he was\nexceptionally well-informed. I even took a pencil and jotted them down.\nI could not help smiling at the document when I had completed it. It\nran in this way\u2014\n\n\nSHERLOCK HOLMES\u2014his limits.\n\n\n1. Knowledge of Literature.\u2014Nil.\n2. Philosophy.\u2014Nil.\n3. Astronomy.\u2014Nil.\n4. Politics.\u2014Feeble.\n5. Botany.\u2014Variable. Well up in belladonna, opium, and poisons\ngenerally. Knows nothing of practical gardening.\n6. Geology.\u2014Practical, but limited. Tells at a glance different soils\nfrom each other. After walks has shown me splashes upon his trousers,\nand told me by their colour and consistence in what part of London he\nhad received them.\n7. Chemistry.\u2014Profound.\n8. Anatomy.\u2014Accurate, but unsystematic.\n9. Sensational Literature.\u2014Immense. He appears to know every detail of\nevery horror perpetrated in the century.\n10. Plays the violin well.\n11. Is an expert singlestick player, boxer, and swordsman.\n12. Has a good practical knowledge of British law.\n\n\nWhen I had got so far in my list I threw it into the fire in despair.\n\u201cIf I can only find what the fellow is driving at by reconciling all\nthese accomplishments, and discovering a calling which needs them all,\u201d\nI said to myself, \u201cI may as well give up the attempt at once.\u201d\n\nI see that I have alluded above to his powers upon the violin. These\nwere very remarkable, but as eccentric as all his other\naccomplishments. That he could play pieces, and difficult pieces, I\nknew well, because at my request he has played me some of Mendelssohn\u2019s\nLieder, and other favourites. When left to himself, however, he would\nseldom produce any music or attempt any recognized air. Leaning back in\nhis arm-chair of an evening, he would close his eyes and scrape\ncarelessly at the fiddle which was thrown across his knee. Sometimes\nthe chords were sonorous and melancholy. Occasionally they were\nfantastic and cheerful. Clearly they reflected the thoughts which\npossessed him, but whether the music aided those thoughts, or whether\nthe playing was simply the result of a whim or fancy was more than I\ncould determine. I might have rebelled against these exasperating solos\nhad it not been that he usually terminated them by playing in quick\nsuccession a whole series of my favourite airs as a slight compensation\nfor the trial upon my patience.\n\nDuring the first week or so we had no callers, and I had begun to think\nthat my companion was as friendless a man as I was myself. Presently,\nhowever, I found that he had many acquaintances, and those in the most\ndifferent classes of society. There was one little sallow rat-faced,\ndark-eyed fellow who was introduced to me as Mr. Lestrade, and who came\nthree or four times in a single week. One morning a young girl called,\nfashionably dressed, and stayed for half an hour or more. The same\nafternoon brought a grey-headed, seedy visitor, looking like a Jew\npedlar, who appeared to me to be much excited, and who was closely\nfollowed by a slip-shod elderly woman. On another occasion an old\nwhite-haired gentleman had an interview with my companion; and on\nanother a railway porter in his velveteen uniform. When any of these\nnondescript individuals put in an appearance, Sherlock Holmes used to\nbeg for the use of the sitting-room, and I would retire to my bed-room.\nHe always apologized to me for putting me to this inconvenience. \u201cI\nhave to use this room as a place of business,\u201d he said, \u201cand these\npeople are my clients.\u201d Again I had an opportunity of asking him a\npoint blank question, and again my delicacy prevented me from forcing\nanother man to confide in me. I imagined at the time that he had some\nstrong reason for not alluding to it, but he soon dispelled the idea by\ncoming round to the subject of his own accord.\n\nIt was upon the 4th of March, as I have good reason to remember, that I\nrose somewhat earlier than usual, and found that Sherlock Holmes had\nnot yet finished his breakfast. The landlady had become so accustomed\nto my late habits that my place had not been laid nor my coffee\nprepared. With the unreasonable petulance of mankind I rang the bell\nand gave a curt intimation that I was ready. Then I picked up a\nmagazine from the table and attempted to while away the time with it,\nwhile my companion munched silently at his toast. One of the articles\nhad a pencil mark at the heading, and I naturally began to run my eye\nthrough it.\n\nIts somewhat ambitious title was \u201cThe Book of Life,\u201d and it attempted\nto show how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and\nsystematic examination of all that came in his way. It struck me as\nbeing a remarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity. The\nreasoning was close and intense, but the deductions appeared to me to\nbe far-fetched and exaggerated. The writer claimed by a momentary\nexpression, a twitch of a muscle or a glance of an eye, to fathom a\nman\u2019s inmost thoughts. Deceit, according to him, was an impossibility\nin the case of one trained to observation and analysis. His conclusions\nwere as infallible as so many propositions of Euclid. So startling\nwould his results appear to the uninitiated that until they learned the\nprocesses by which he had arrived at them they might well consider him\nas a necromancer.\n\n\u201cFrom a drop of water,\u201d said the writer, \u201ca logician could infer the\npossibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of\none or the other. So all life is a great chain, the nature of which is\nknown whenever we are shown a single link of it. Like all other arts,\nthe Science of Deduction and Analysis is one which can only be acquired\nby long and patient study nor, is life long enough to allow any mortal\nto attain the highest possible perfection in it. Before turning to\nthose moral and mental aspects of the matter which present the greatest\ndifficulties, let the enquirer begin by mastering more elementary\nproblems. Let him, on meeting a fellow-mortal, learn at a glance to\ndistinguish the history of the man, and the trade or profession to\nwhich he belongs. Puerile as such an exercise may seem, it sharpens the\nfaculties of observation, and teaches one where to look and what to\nlook for. By a man\u2019s finger nails, by his coat-sleeve, by his boot, by\nhis trouser knees, by the callosities of his forefinger and thumb, by\nhis expression, by his shirt cuffs\u2014by each of these things a man\u2019s\ncalling is plainly revealed. That all united should fail to enlighten\nthe competent enquirer in any case is almost inconceivable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat ineffable twaddle!\u201d I cried, slapping the magazine down on the\ntable, \u201cI never read such rubbish in my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Sherlock Holmes.\n\n\u201cWhy, this article,\u201d I said, pointing at it with my egg spoon as I sat\ndown to my breakfast. \u201cI see that you have read it since you have\nmarked it. I don\u2019t deny that it is smartly written. It irritates me\nthough. It is evidently the theory of some arm-chair lounger who\nevolves all these neat little paradoxes in the seclusion of his own\nstudy. It is not practical. I should like to see him clapped down in a\nthird class carriage on the Underground, and asked to give the trades\nof all his fellow-travellers. I would lay a thousand to one against\nhim.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou would lose your money,\u201d Sherlock Holmes remarked calmly. \u201cAs for\nthe article I wrote it myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I have a turn both for observation and for deduction. The\ntheories which I have expressed there, and which appear to you to be so\nchimerical are really extremely practical\u2014so practical that I depend\nupon them for my bread and cheese.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how?\u201d I asked involuntarily.\n\n\u201cWell, I have a trade of my own. I suppose I am the only one in the\nworld. I\u2019m a consulting detective, if you can understand what that is.\nHere in London we have lots of Government detectives and lots of\nprivate ones. When these fellows are at fault they come to me, and I\nmanage to put them on the right scent. They lay all the evidence before\nme, and I am generally able, by the help of my knowledge of the history\nof crime, to set them straight. There is a strong family resemblance\nabout misdeeds, and if you have all the details of a thousand at your\nfinger ends, it is odd if you can\u2019t unravel the thousand and first.\nLestrade is a well-known detective. He got himself into a fog recently\nover a forgery case, and that was what brought him here.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd these other people?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are mostly sent on by private inquiry agencies. They are all\npeople who are in trouble about something, and want a little\nenlightening. I listen to their story, they listen to my comments, and\nthen I pocket my fee.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut do you mean to say,\u201d I said, \u201cthat without leaving your room you\ncan unravel some knot which other men can make nothing of, although\nthey have seen every detail for themselves?\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite so. I have a kind of intuition that way. Now and again a case\nturns up which is a little more complex. Then I have to bustle about\nand see things with my own eyes. You see I have a lot of special\nknowledge which I apply to the problem, and which facilitates matters\nwonderfully. Those rules of deduction laid down in that article which\naroused your scorn, are invaluable to me in practical work. Observation\nwith me is second nature. You appeared to be surprised when I told you,\non our first meeting, that you had come from Afghanistan.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were told, no doubt.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing of the sort. I _knew_ you came from Afghanistan. From long\nhabit the train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my mind, that I\narrived at the conclusion without being conscious of intermediate\nsteps. There were such steps, however. The train of reasoning ran,\n\u2018Here is a gentleman of a medical type, but with the air of a military\nman. Clearly an army doctor, then. He has just come from the tropics,\nfor his face is dark, and that is not the natural tint of his skin, for\nhis wrists are fair. He has undergone hardship and sickness, as his\nhaggard face says clearly. His left arm has been injured. He holds it\nin a stiff and unnatural manner. Where in the tropics could an English\narmy doctor have seen much hardship and got his arm wounded? Clearly in\nAfghanistan.\u2019 The whole train of thought did not occupy a second. I\nthen remarked that you came from Afghanistan, and you were astonished.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is simple enough as you explain it,\u201d I said, smiling. \u201cYou remind\nme of Edgar Allen Poe\u2019s Dupin. I had no idea that such individuals did\nexist outside of stories.\u201d\n\nSherlock Holmes rose and lit his pipe. \u201cNo doubt you think that you are\ncomplimenting me in comparing me to Dupin,\u201d he observed. \u201cNow, in my\nopinion, Dupin was a very inferior fellow. That trick of his of\nbreaking in on his friends\u2019 thoughts with an apropos remark after a\nquarter of an hour\u2019s silence is really very showy and superficial. He\nhad some analytical genius, no doubt; but he was by no means such a\nphenomenon as Poe appeared to imagine.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you read Gaboriau\u2019s works?\u201d I asked. \u201cDoes Lecoq come up to your\nidea of a detective?\u201d\n\nSherlock Holmes sniffed sardonically. \u201cLecoq was a miserable bungler,\u201d\nhe said, in an angry voice; \u201che had only one thing to recommend him,\nand that was his energy. That book made me positively ill. The question\nwas how to identify an unknown prisoner. I could have done it in\ntwenty-four hours. Lecoq took six months or so. It might be made a\ntext-book for detectives to teach them what to avoid.\u201d\n\nI felt rather indignant at having two characters whom I had admired\ntreated in this cavalier style. I walked over to the window, and stood\nlooking out into the busy street. \u201cThis fellow may be very clever,\u201d I\nsaid to myself, \u201cbut he is certainly very conceited.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are no crimes and no criminals in these days,\u201d he said,\nquerulously. \u201cWhat is the use of having brains in our profession. I\nknow well that I have it in me to make my name famous. No man lives or\nhas ever lived who has brought the same amount of study and of natural\ntalent to the detection of crime which I have done. And what is the\nresult? There is no crime to detect, or, at most, some bungling\nvillainy with a motive so transparent that even a Scotland Yard\nofficial can see through it.\u201d\n\nI was still annoyed at his bumptious style of conversation. I thought\nit best to change the topic.\n\n\u201cI wonder what that fellow is looking for?\u201d I asked, pointing to a\nstalwart, plainly-dressed individual who was walking slowly down the\nother side of the street, looking anxiously at the numbers. He had a\nlarge blue envelope in his hand, and was evidently the bearer of a\nmessage.\n\n\u201cYou mean the retired sergeant of Marines,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes.\n\n\u201cBrag and bounce!\u201d thought I to myself. \u201cHe knows that I cannot verify\nhis guess.\u201d\n\nThe thought had hardly passed through my mind when the man whom we were\nwatching caught sight of the number on our door, and ran rapidly across\nthe roadway. We heard a loud knock, a deep voice below, and heavy steps\nascending the stair.\n\n\u201cFor Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\u201d he said, stepping into the room and handing\nmy friend the letter.\n\nHere was an opportunity of taking the conceit out of him. He little\nthought of this when he made that random shot. \u201cMay I ask, my lad,\u201d I\nsaid, in the blandest voice, \u201cwhat your trade may be?\u201d\n\n\u201cCommissionaire, sir,\u201d he said, gruffly. \u201cUniform away for repairs.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you were?\u201d I asked, with a slightly malicious glance at my\ncompanion.\n\n\u201cA sergeant, sir, Royal Marine Light Infantry, sir. No answer? Right,\nsir.\u201d\n\nHe clicked his heels together, raised his hand in a salute, and was\ngone.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\nTHE LAURISTON GARDENS MYSTERY\n\n\nI confess that I was considerably startled by this fresh proof of the\npractical nature of my companion\u2019s theories. My respect for his powers\nof analysis increased wondrously. There still remained some lurking\nsuspicion in my mind, however, that the whole thing was a pre-arranged\nepisode, intended to dazzle me, though what earthly object he could\nhave in taking me in was past my comprehension. When I looked at him he\nhad finished reading the note, and his eyes had assumed the vacant,\nlack-lustre expression which showed mental abstraction.\n\n\u201cHow in the world did you deduce that?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cDeduce what?\u201d said he, petulantly.\n\n\u201cWhy, that he was a retired sergeant of Marines.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no time for trifles,\u201d he answered, brusquely; then with a\nsmile, \u201cExcuse my rudeness. You broke the thread of my thoughts; but\nperhaps it is as well. So you actually were not able to see that that\nman was a sergeant of Marines?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, indeed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was easier to know it than to explain why I knew it. If you were\nasked to prove that two and two made four, you might find some\ndifficulty, and yet you are quite sure of the fact. Even across the\nstreet I could see a great blue anchor tattooed on the back of the\nfellow\u2019s hand. That smacked of the sea. He had a military carriage,\nhowever, and regulation side whiskers. There we have the marine. He was\na man with some amount of self-importance and a certain air of command.\nYou must have observed the way in which he held his head and swung his\ncane. A steady, respectable, middle-aged man, too, on the face of\nhim\u2014all facts which led me to believe that he had been a sergeant.\u201d\n\n\u201cWonderful!\u201d I ejaculated.\n\n\u201cCommonplace,\u201d said Holmes, though I thought from his expression that\nhe was pleased at my evident surprise and admiration. \u201cI said just now\nthat there were no criminals. It appears that I am wrong\u2014look at this!\u201d\nHe threw me over the note which the commissionaire had brought.\n\n\u201cWhy,\u201d I cried, as I cast my eye over it, \u201cthis is terrible!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does seem to be a little out of the common,\u201d he remarked, calmly.\n\u201cWould you mind reading it to me aloud?\u201d\n\nThis is the letter which I read to him\u2014\n\n\u201cMY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,\u2014\n\n\u201cThere has been a bad business during the night at 3, Lauriston\nGardens, off the Brixton Road. Our man on the beat saw a light there\nabout two in the morning, and as the house was an empty one, suspected\nthat something was amiss. He found the door open, and in the front\nroom, which is bare of furniture, discovered the body of a gentleman,\nwell dressed, and having cards in his pocket bearing the name of \u2018Enoch\nJ. Drebber, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.A.\u2019 There had been no robbery, nor is\nthere any evidence as to how the man met his death. There are marks of\nblood in the room, but there is no wound upon his person. We are at a\nloss as to how he came into the empty house; indeed, the whole affair\nis a puzzler. If you can come round to the house any time before\ntwelve, you will find me there. I have left everything _in statu quo_\nuntil I hear from you. If you are unable to come I shall give you\nfuller details, and would esteem it a great kindness if you would\nfavour me with your opinion.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\u201cTOBIAS GREGSON.\u201d\n\n\u201cGregson is the smartest of the Scotland Yarders,\u201d my friend remarked;\n\u201che and Lestrade are the pick of a bad lot. They are both quick and\nenergetic, but conventional\u2014shockingly so. They have their knives into\none another, too. They are as jealous as a pair of professional\nbeauties. There will be some fun over this case if they are both put\nupon the scent.\u201d\n\nI was amazed at the calm way in which he rippled on. \u201cSurely there is\nnot a moment to be lost,\u201d I cried, \u201cshall I go and order you a cab?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure about whether I shall go. I am the most incurably lazy\ndevil that ever stood in shoe leather\u2014that is, when the fit is on me,\nfor I can be spry enough at times.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, it is just such a chance as you have been longing for.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear fellow, what does it matter to me. Supposing I unravel the\nwhole matter, you may be sure that Gregson, Lestrade, and Co. will\npocket all the credit. That comes of being an unofficial personage.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut he begs you to help him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. He knows that I am his superior, and acknowledges it to me; but\nhe would cut his tongue out before he would own it to any third person.\nHowever, we may as well go and have a look. I shall work it out on my\nown hook. I may have a laugh at them if I have nothing else. Come on!\u201d\n\nHe hustled on his overcoat, and bustled about in a way that showed that\nan energetic fit had superseded the apathetic one.\n\n\u201cGet your hat,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou wish me to come?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, if you have nothing better to do.\u201d A minute later we were both in\na hansom, driving furiously for the Brixton Road.\n\nIt was a foggy, cloudy morning, and a dun-coloured veil hung over the\nhouse-tops, looking like the reflection of the mud-coloured streets\nbeneath. My companion was in the best of spirits, and prattled away\nabout Cremona fiddles, and the difference between a Stradivarius and an\nAmati. As for myself, I was silent, for the dull weather and the\nmelancholy business upon which we were engaged, depressed my spirits.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to give much thought to the matter in hand,\u201d I said at\nlast, interrupting Holmes\u2019 musical disquisition.\n\n\u201cNo data yet,\u201d he answered. \u201cIt is a capital mistake to theorize before\nyou have all the evidence. It biases the judgment.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will have your data soon,\u201d I remarked, pointing with my finger;\n\u201cthis is the Brixton Road, and that is the house, if I am not very much\nmistaken.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it is. Stop, driver, stop!\u201d We were still a hundred yards or so\nfrom it, but he insisted upon our alighting, and we finished our\njourney upon foot.\n\nNumber 3, Lauriston Gardens wore an ill-omened and minatory look. It\nwas one of four which stood back some little way from the street, two\nbeing occupied and two empty. The latter looked out with three tiers of\nvacant melancholy windows, which were blank and dreary, save that here\nand there a \u201cTo Let\u201d card had developed like a cataract upon the\nbleared panes. A small garden sprinkled over with a scattered eruption\nof sickly plants separated each of these houses from the street, and\nwas traversed by a narrow pathway, yellowish in colour, and consisting\napparently of a mixture of clay and of gravel. The whole place was very\nsloppy from the rain which had fallen through the night. The garden was\nbounded by a three-foot brick wall with a fringe of wood rails upon the\ntop, and against this wall was leaning a stalwart police constable,\nsurrounded by a small knot of loafers, who craned their necks and\nstrained their eyes in the vain hope of catching some glimpse of the\nproceedings within.\n\nI had imagined that Sherlock Holmes would at once have hurried into the\nhouse and plunged into a study of the mystery. Nothing appeared to be\nfurther from his intention. With an air of nonchalance which, under the\ncircumstances, seemed to me to border upon affectation, he lounged up\nand down the pavement, and gazed vacantly at the ground, the sky, the\nopposite houses and the line of railings. Having finished his scrutiny,\nhe proceeded slowly down the path, or rather down the fringe of grass\nwhich flanked the path, keeping his eyes riveted upon the ground. Twice\nhe stopped, and once I saw him smile, and heard him utter an\nexclamation of satisfaction. There were many marks of footsteps upon\nthe wet clayey soil, but since the police had been coming and going\nover it, I was unable to see how my companion could hope to learn\nanything from it. Still I had had such extraordinary evidence of the\nquickness of his perceptive faculties, that I had no doubt that he\ncould see a great deal which was hidden from me.\n\nAt the door of the house we were met by a tall, white-faced,\nflaxen-haired man, with a notebook in his hand, who rushed forward and\nwrung my companion\u2019s hand with effusion. \u201cIt is indeed kind of you to\ncome,\u201d he said, \u201cI have had everything left untouched.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcept that!\u201d my friend answered, pointing at the pathway. \u201cIf a herd\nof buffaloes had passed along there could not be a greater mess. No\ndoubt, however, you had drawn your own conclusions, Gregson, before you\npermitted this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have had so much to do inside the house,\u201d the detective said\nevasively. \u201cMy colleague, Mr. Lestrade, is here. I had relied upon him\nto look after this.\u201d\n\nHolmes glanced at me and raised his eyebrows sardonically. \u201cWith two\nsuch men as yourself and Lestrade upon the ground, there will not be\nmuch for a third party to find out,\u201d he said.\n\nGregson rubbed his hands in a self-satisfied way. \u201cI think we have done\nall that can be done,\u201d he answered; \u201cit\u2019s a queer case though, and I\nknew your taste for such things.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did not come here in a cab?\u201d asked Sherlock Holmes.\n\n\u201cNo, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cNor Lestrade?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen let us go and look at the room.\u201d With which inconsequent remark\nhe strode on into the house, followed by Gregson, whose features\nexpressed his astonishment.\n\nA short passage, bare planked and dusty, led to the kitchen and\noffices. Two doors opened out of it to the left and to the right. One\nof these had obviously been closed for many weeks. The other belonged\nto the dining-room, which was the apartment in which the mysterious\naffair had occurred. Holmes walked in, and I followed him with that\nsubdued feeling at my heart which the presence of death inspires.\n\nIt was a large square room, looking all the larger from the absence of\nall furniture. A vulgar flaring paper adorned the walls, but it was\nblotched in places with mildew, and here and there great strips had\nbecome detached and hung down, exposing the yellow plaster beneath.\nOpposite the door was a showy fireplace, surmounted by a mantelpiece of\nimitation white marble. On one corner of this was stuck the stump of a\nred wax candle. The solitary window was so dirty that the light was\nhazy and uncertain, giving a dull grey tinge to everything, which was\nintensified by the thick layer of dust which coated the whole\napartment.\n\nAll these details I observed afterwards. At present my attention was\ncentred upon the single grim motionless figure which lay stretched upon\nthe boards, with vacant sightless eyes staring up at the discoloured\nceiling. It was that of a man about forty-three or forty-four years of\nage, middle-sized, broad shouldered, with crisp curling black hair, and\na short stubbly beard. He was dressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat\nand waistcoat, with light-coloured trousers, and immaculate collar and\ncuffs. A top hat, well brushed and trim, was placed upon the floor\nbeside him. His hands were clenched and his arms thrown abroad, while\nhis lower limbs were interlocked as though his death struggle had been\na grievous one. On his rigid face there stood an expression of horror,\nand as it seemed to me, of hatred, such as I have never seen upon human\nfeatures. This malignant and terrible contortion, combined with the low\nforehead, blunt nose, and prognathous jaw gave the dead man a\nsingularly simious and ape-like appearance, which was increased by his\nwrithing, unnatural posture. I have seen death in many forms, but never\nhas it appeared to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark grimy\napartment, which looked out upon one of the main arteries of suburban\nLondon.\n\nLestrade, lean and ferret-like as ever, was standing by the doorway,\nand greeted my companion and myself.\n\n\u201cThis case will make a stir, sir,\u201d he remarked. \u201cIt beats anything I\nhave seen, and I am no chicken.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no clue?\u201d said Gregson.\n\n\u201cNone at all,\u201d chimed in Lestrade.\n\nSherlock Holmes approached the body, and, kneeling down, examined it\nintently. \u201cYou are sure that there is no wound?\u201d he asked, pointing to\nnumerous gouts and splashes of blood which lay all round.\n\n\u201cPositive!\u201d cried both detectives.\n\n\u201cThen, of course, this blood belongs to a second individual\u2014presumably\nthe murderer, if murder has been committed. It reminds me of the\ncircumstances attendant on the death of Van Jansen, in Utrecht, in the\nyear \u201834. Do you remember the case, Gregson?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cRead it up\u2014you really should. There is nothing new under the sun. It\nhas all been done before.\u201d\n\nAs he spoke, his nimble fingers were flying here, there, and\neverywhere, feeling, pressing, unbuttoning, examining, while his eyes\nwore the same far-away expression which I have already remarked upon.\nSo swiftly was the examination made, that one would hardly have guessed\nthe minuteness with which it was conducted. Finally, he sniffed the\ndead man\u2019s lips, and then glanced at the soles of his patent leather\nboots.\n\n\u201cHe has not been moved at all?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cNo more than was necessary for the purposes of our examination.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can take him to the mortuary now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is nothing more\nto be learned.\u201d\n\nGregson had a stretcher and four men at hand. At his call they entered\nthe room, and the stranger was lifted and carried out. As they raised\nhim, a ring tinkled down and rolled across the floor. Lestrade grabbed\nit up and stared at it with mystified eyes.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a woman here,\u201d he cried. \u201cIt\u2019s a woman\u2019s wedding-ring.\u201d\n\nHe held it out, as he spoke, upon the palm of his hand. We all gathered\nround him and gazed at it. There could be no doubt that that circlet of\nplain gold had once adorned the finger of a bride.\n\n\u201cThis complicates matters,\u201d said Gregson. \u201cHeaven knows, they were\ncomplicated enough before.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure it doesn\u2019t simplify them?\u201d observed Holmes. \u201cThere\u2019s\nnothing to be learned by staring at it. What did you find in his\npockets?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have it all here,\u201d said Gregson, pointing to a litter of objects\nupon one of the bottom steps of the stairs. \u201cA gold watch, No. 97163,\nby Barraud, of London. Gold Albert chain, very heavy and solid. Gold\nring, with masonic device. Gold pin\u2014bull-dog\u2019s head, with rubies as\neyes. Russian leather card-case, with cards of Enoch J. Drebber of\nCleveland, corresponding with the E. J. D. upon the linen. No purse,\nbut loose money to the extent of seven pounds thirteen. Pocket edition\nof Boccaccio\u2019s _Decameron_, with name of Joseph Stangerson upon the\nfly-leaf. Two letters\u2014one addressed to E. J. Drebber and one to Joseph\nStangerson.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt what address?\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerican Exchange, Strand\u2014to be left till called for. They are both\nfrom the Guion Steamship Company, and refer to the sailing of their\nboats from Liverpool. It is clear that this unfortunate man was about\nto return to New York.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you made any inquiries as to this man, Stangerson?\u201d\n\n\u201cI did it at once, sir,\u201d said Gregson. \u201cI have had advertisements sent\nto all the newspapers, and one of my men has gone to the American\nExchange, but he has not returned yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you sent to Cleveland?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe telegraphed this morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you word your inquiries?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe simply detailed the circumstances, and said that we should be glad\nof any information which could help us.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did not ask for particulars on any point which appeared to you to\nbe crucial?\u201d\n\n\u201cI asked about Stangerson.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing else? Is there no circumstance on which this whole case\nappears to hinge? Will you not telegraph again?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have said all I have to say,\u201d said Gregson, in an offended voice.\n\nSherlock Holmes chuckled to himself, and appeared to be about to make\nsome remark, when Lestrade, who had been in the front room while we\nwere holding this conversation in the hall, reappeared upon the scene,\nrubbing his hands in a pompous and self-satisfied manner.\n\n\u201cMr. Gregson,\u201d he said, \u201cI have just made a discovery of the highest\nimportance, and one which would have been overlooked had I not made a\ncareful examination of the walls.\u201d\n\nThe little man\u2019s eyes sparkled as he spoke, and he was evidently in a\nstate of suppressed exultation at having scored a point against his\ncolleague.\n\n\u201cCome here,\u201d he said, bustling back into the room, the atmosphere of\nwhich felt clearer since the removal of its ghastly inmate. \u201cNow, stand\nthere!\u201d\n\nHe struck a match on his boot and held it up against the wall.\n\n\u201cLook at that!\u201d he said, triumphantly.\n\nI have remarked that the paper had fallen away in parts. In this\nparticular corner of the room a large piece had peeled off, leaving a\nyellow square of coarse plastering. Across this bare space there was\nscrawled in blood-red letters a single word\u2014\n\n\nRACHE.\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you think of that?\u201d cried the detective, with the air of a\nshowman exhibiting his show. \u201cThis was overlooked because it was in the\ndarkest corner of the room, and no one thought of looking there. The\nmurderer has written it with his or her own blood. See this smear where\nit has trickled down the wall! That disposes of the idea of suicide\nanyhow. Why was that corner chosen to write it on? I will tell you. See\nthat candle on the mantelpiece. It was lit at the time, and if it was\nlit this corner would be the brightest instead of the darkest portion\nof the wall.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what does it mean now that you _have_ found it?\u201d asked Gregson in\na depreciatory voice.\n\n\u201cMean? Why, it means that the writer was going to put the female name\nRachel, but was disturbed before he or she had time to finish. You mark\nmy words, when this case comes to be cleared up you will find that a\nwoman named Rachel has something to do with it. It\u2019s all very well for\nyou to laugh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes. You may be very smart and clever,\nbut the old hound is the best, when all is said and done.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really beg your pardon!\u201d said my companion, who had ruffled the\nlittle man\u2019s temper by bursting into an explosion of laughter. \u201cYou\ncertainly have the credit of being the first of us to find this out,\nand, as you say, it bears every mark of having been written by the\nother participant in last night\u2019s mystery. I have not had time to\nexamine this room yet, but with your permission I shall do so now.\u201d\n\nAs he spoke, he whipped a tape measure and a large round magnifying\nglass from his pocket. With these two implements he trotted noiselessly\nabout the room, sometimes stopping, occasionally kneeling, and once\nlying flat upon his face. So engrossed was he with his occupation that\nhe appeared to have forgotten our presence, for he chattered away to\nhimself under his breath the whole time, keeping up a running fire of\nexclamations, groans, whistles, and little cries suggestive of\nencouragement and of hope. As I watched him I was irresistibly reminded\nof a pure-blooded well-trained foxhound as it dashes backwards and\nforwards through the covert, whining in its eagerness, until it comes\nacross the lost scent. For twenty minutes or more he continued his\nresearches, measuring with the most exact care the distance between\nmarks which were entirely invisible to me, and occasionally applying\nhis tape to the walls in an equally incomprehensible manner. In one\nplace he gathered up very carefully a little pile of grey dust from the\nfloor, and packed it away in an envelope. Finally, he examined with his\nglass the word upon the wall, going over every letter of it with the\nmost minute exactness. This done, he appeared to be satisfied, for he\nreplaced his tape and his glass in his pocket.\n\n\u201cThey say that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains,\u201d he\nremarked with a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s a very bad definition, but it does apply\nto detective work.\u201d\n\nGregson and Lestrade had watched the man\u0153uvres of their amateur\ncompanion with considerable curiosity and some contempt. They evidently\nfailed to appreciate the fact, which I had begun to realize, that\nSherlock Holmes\u2019 smallest actions were all directed towards some\ndefinite and practical end.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think of it, sir?\u201d they both asked.\n\n\u201cIt would be robbing you of the credit of the case if I was to presume\nto help you,\u201d remarked my friend. \u201cYou are doing so well now that it\nwould be a pity for anyone to interfere.\u201d There was a world of sarcasm\nin his voice as he spoke. \u201cIf you will let me know how your\ninvestigations go,\u201d he continued, \u201cI shall be happy to give you any\nhelp I can. In the meantime I should like to speak to the constable who\nfound the body. Can you give me his name and address?\u201d\n\nLestrade glanced at his note-book. \u201cJohn Rance,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is off\nduty now. You will find him at 46, Audley Court, Kennington Park Gate.\u201d\n\nHolmes took a note of the address.\n\n\u201cCome along, Doctor,\u201d he said; \u201cwe shall go and look him up. I\u2019ll tell\nyou one thing which may help you in the case,\u201d he continued, turning to\nthe two detectives. \u201cThere has been murder done, and the murderer was a\nman. He was more than six feet high, was in the prime of life, had\nsmall feet for his height, wore coarse, square-toed boots and smoked a\nTrichinopoly cigar. He came here with his victim in a four-wheeled cab,\nwhich was drawn by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on his\noff fore leg. In all probability the murderer had a florid face, and\nthe finger-nails of his right hand were remarkably long. These are only\na few indications, but they may assist you.\u201d\n\nLestrade and Gregson glanced at each other with an incredulous smile.\n\n\u201cIf this man was murdered, how was it done?\u201d asked the former.\n\n\u201cPoison,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes curtly, and strode off. \u201cOne other\nthing, Lestrade,\u201d he added, turning round at the door: \u201c\u2018Rache,\u2019 is the\nGerman for \u2018revenge;\u2019 so don\u2019t lose your time looking for Miss Rachel.\u201d\n\nWith which Parthian shot he walked away, leaving the two rivals\nopen-mouthed behind him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\nWHAT JOHN RANCE HAD TO TELL.\n\n\nIt was one o\u2019clock when we left No. 3, Lauriston Gardens. Sherlock\nHolmes led me to the nearest telegraph office, whence he dispatched a\nlong telegram. He then hailed a cab, and ordered the driver to take us\nto the address given us by Lestrade.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing like first hand evidence,\u201d he remarked; \u201cas a matter\nof fact, my mind is entirely made up upon the case, but still we may as\nwell learn all that is to be learned.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou amaze me, Holmes,\u201d said I. \u201cSurely you are not as sure as you\npretend to be of all those particulars which you gave.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no room for a mistake,\u201d he answered. \u201cThe very first thing\nwhich I observed on arriving there was that a cab had made two ruts\nwith its wheels close to the curb. Now, up to last night, we have had\nno rain for a week, so that those wheels which left such a deep\nimpression must have been there during the night. There were the marks\nof the horse\u2019s hoofs, too, the outline of one of which was far more\nclearly cut than that of the other three, showing that that was a new\nshoe. Since the cab was there after the rain began, and was not there\nat any time during the morning\u2014I have Gregson\u2019s word for that\u2014it\nfollows that it must have been there during the night, and, therefore,\nthat it brought those two individuals to the house.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat seems simple enough,\u201d said I; \u201cbut how about the other man\u2019s\nheight?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, the height of a man, in nine cases out of ten, can be told from\nthe length of his stride. It is a simple calculation enough, though\nthere is no use my boring you with figures. I had this fellow\u2019s stride\nboth on the clay outside and on the dust within. Then I had a way of\nchecking my calculation. When a man writes on a wall, his instinct\nleads him to write about the level of his own eyes. Now that writing\nwas just over six feet from the ground. It was child\u2019s play.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd his age?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cWell, if a man can stride four and a-half feet without the smallest\neffort, he can\u2019t be quite in the sere and yellow. That was the breadth\nof a puddle on the garden walk which he had evidently walked across.\nPatent-leather boots had gone round, and Square-toes had hopped over.\nThere is no mystery about it at all. I am simply applying to ordinary\nlife a few of those precepts of observation and deduction which I\nadvocated in that article. Is there anything else that puzzles you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe finger nails and the Trichinopoly,\u201d I suggested.\n\n\u201cThe writing on the wall was done with a man\u2019s forefinger dipped in\nblood. My glass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly\nscratched in doing it, which would not have been the case if the man\u2019s\nnail had been trimmed. I gathered up some scattered ash from the floor.\nIt was dark in colour and flakey\u2014such an ash as is only made by a\nTrichinopoly. I have made a special study of cigar ashes\u2014in fact, I\nhave written a monograph upon the subject. I flatter myself that I can\ndistinguish at a glance the ash of any known brand, either of cigar or\nof tobacco. It is just in such details that the skilled detective\ndiffers from the Gregson and Lestrade type.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the florid face?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cAh, that was a more daring shot, though I have no doubt that I was\nright. You must not ask me that at the present state of the affair.\u201d\n\nI passed my hand over my brow. \u201cMy head is in a whirl,\u201d I remarked;\n\u201cthe more one thinks of it the more mysterious it grows. How came these\ntwo men\u2014if there were two men\u2014into an empty house? What has become of\nthe cabman who drove them? How could one man compel another to take\npoison? Where did the blood come from? What was the object of the\nmurderer, since robbery had no part in it? How came the woman\u2019s ring\nthere? Above all, why should the second man write up the German word\nRACHE before decamping? I confess that I cannot see any possible way of\nreconciling all these facts.\u201d\n\nMy companion smiled approvingly.\n\n\u201cYou sum up the difficulties of the situation succinctly and well,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cThere is much that is still obscure, though I have quite made up\nmy mind on the main facts. As to poor Lestrade\u2019s discovery it was\nsimply a blind intended to put the police upon a wrong track, by\nsuggesting Socialism and secret societies. It was not done by a German.\nThe A, if you noticed, was printed somewhat after the German fashion.\nNow, a real German invariably prints in the Latin character, so that we\nmay safely say that this was not written by one, but by a clumsy\nimitator who overdid his part. It was simply a ruse to divert inquiry\ninto a wrong channel. I\u2019m not going to tell you much more of the case,\nDoctor. You know a conjuror gets no credit when once he has explained\nhis trick, and if I show you too much of my method of working, you will\ncome to the conclusion that I am a very ordinary individual after all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall never do that,\u201d I answered; \u201cyou have brought detection as\nnear an exact science as it ever will be brought in this world.\u201d\n\nMy companion flushed up with pleasure at my words, and the earnest way\nin which I uttered them. I had already observed that he was as\nsensitive to flattery on the score of his art as any girl could be of\nher beauty.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you one other thing,\u201d he said. \u201cPatent-leathers and\nSquare-toes came in the same cab, and they walked down the pathway\ntogether as friendly as possible\u2014arm-in-arm, in all probability. When\nthey got inside they walked up and down the room\u2014or rather,\nPatent-leathers stood still while Square-toes walked up and down. I\ncould read all that in the dust; and I could read that as he walked he\ngrew more and more excited. That is shown by the increased length of\nhis strides. He was talking all the while, and working himself up, no\ndoubt, into a fury. Then the tragedy occurred. I\u2019ve told you all I know\nmyself now, for the rest is mere surmise and conjecture. We have a good\nworking basis, however, on which to start. We must hurry up, for I want\nto go to Halle\u2019s concert to hear Norman Neruda this afternoon.\u201d\n\nThis conversation had occurred while our cab had been threading its way\nthrough a long succession of dingy streets and dreary by-ways. In the\ndingiest and dreariest of them our driver suddenly came to a stand.\n\u201cThat\u2019s Audley Court in there,\u201d he said, pointing to a narrow slit in\nthe line of dead-coloured brick. \u201cYou\u2019ll find me here when you come\nback.\u201d\n\nAudley Court was not an attractive locality. The narrow passage led us\ninto a quadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings. We\npicked our way among groups of dirty children, and through lines of\ndiscoloured linen, until we came to Number 46, the door of which was\ndecorated with a small slip of brass on which the name Rance was\nengraved. On enquiry we found that the constable was in bed, and we\nwere shown into a little front parlour to await his coming.\n\nHe appeared presently, looking a little irritable at being disturbed in\nhis slumbers. \u201cI made my report at the office,\u201d he said.\n\nHolmes took a half-sovereign from his pocket and played with it\npensively. \u201cWe thought that we should like to hear it all from your own\nlips,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI shall be most happy to tell you anything I can,\u201d the constable\nanswered with his eyes upon the little golden disk.\n\n\u201cJust let us hear it all in your own way as it occurred.\u201d\n\nRance sat down on the horsehair sofa, and knitted his brows as though\ndetermined not to omit anything in his narrative.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell it ye from the beginning,\u201d he said. \u201cMy time is from ten at\nnight to six in the morning. At eleven there was a fight at the \u2018White\nHart\u2019; but bar that all was quiet enough on the beat. At one o\u2019clock it\nbegan to rain, and I met Harry Murcher\u2014him who has the Holland Grove\nbeat\u2014and we stood together at the corner of Henrietta Street a-talkin\u2019.\nPresently\u2014maybe about two or a little after\u2014I thought I would take a\nlook round and see that all was right down the Brixton Road. It was\nprecious dirty and lonely. Not a soul did I meet all the way down,\nthough a cab or two went past me. I was a strollin\u2019 down, thinkin\u2019\nbetween ourselves how uncommon handy a four of gin hot would be, when\nsuddenly the glint of a light caught my eye in the window of that same\nhouse. Now, I knew that them two houses in Lauriston Gardens was empty\non account of him that owns them who won\u2019t have the drains seen to,\nthough the very last tenant what lived in one of them died o\u2019 typhoid\nfever. I was knocked all in a heap therefore at seeing a light in the\nwindow, and I suspected as something was wrong. When I got to the\ndoor\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou stopped, and then walked back to the garden gate,\u201d my companion\ninterrupted. \u201cWhat did you do that for?\u201d\n\nRance gave a violent jump, and stared at Sherlock Holmes with the\nutmost amazement upon his features.\n\n\u201cWhy, that\u2019s true, sir,\u201d he said; \u201cthough how you come to know it,\nHeaven only knows. Ye see, when I got up to the door it was so still\nand so lonesome, that I thought I\u2019d be none the worse for some one with\nme. I ain\u2019t afeared of anything on this side o\u2019 the grave; but I\nthought that maybe it was him that died o\u2019 the typhoid inspecting the\ndrains what killed him. The thought gave me a kind o\u2019 turn, and I\nwalked back to the gate to see if I could see Murcher\u2019s lantern, but\nthere wasn\u2019t no sign of him nor of anyone else.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was no one in the street?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a livin\u2019 soul, sir, nor as much as a dog. Then I pulled myself\ntogether and went back and pushed the door open. All was quiet inside,\nso I went into the room where the light was a-burnin\u2019. There was a\ncandle flickerin\u2019 on the mantelpiece\u2014a red wax one\u2014and by its light I\nsaw\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I know all that you saw. You walked round the room several times,\nand you knelt down by the body, and then you walked through and tried\nthe kitchen door, and then\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\nJohn Rance sprang to his feet with a frightened face and suspicion in\nhis eyes. \u201cWhere was you hid to see all that?\u201d he cried. \u201cIt seems to\nme that you knows a deal more than you should.\u201d\n\nHolmes laughed and threw his card across the table to the constable.\n\u201cDon\u2019t get arresting me for the murder,\u201d he said. \u201cI am one of the\nhounds and not the wolf; Mr. Gregson or Mr. Lestrade will answer for\nthat. Go on, though. What did you do next?\u201d\n\nRance resumed his seat, without however losing his mystified\nexpression. \u201cI went back to the gate and sounded my whistle. That\nbrought Murcher and two more to the spot.\u201d\n\n\u201cWas the street empty then?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it was, as far as anybody that could be of any good goes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\nThe constable\u2019s features broadened into a grin. \u201cI\u2019ve seen many a drunk\nchap in my time,\u201d he said, \u201cbut never anyone so cryin\u2019 drunk as that\ncove. He was at the gate when I came out, a-leanin\u2019 up agin the\nrailings, and a-singin\u2019 at the pitch o\u2019 his lungs about Columbine\u2019s\nNew-fangled Banner, or some such stuff. He couldn\u2019t stand, far less\nhelp.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat sort of a man was he?\u201d asked Sherlock Holmes.\n\nJohn Rance appeared to be somewhat irritated at this digression. \u201cHe\nwas an uncommon drunk sort o\u2019 man,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019d ha\u2019 found hisself in\nthe station if we hadn\u2019t been so took up.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis face\u2014his dress\u2014didn\u2019t you notice them?\u201d Holmes broke in\nimpatiently.\n\n\u201cI should think I did notice them, seeing that I had to prop him up\u2014me\nand Murcher between us. He was a long chap, with a red face, the lower\npart muffled round\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat will do,\u201d cried Holmes. \u201cWhat became of him?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d enough to do without lookin\u2019 after him,\u201d the policeman said, in\nan aggrieved voice. \u201cI\u2019ll wager he found his way home all right.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow was he dressed?\u201d\n\n\u201cA brown overcoat.\u201d\n\n\u201cHad he a whip in his hand?\u201d\n\n\u201cA whip\u2014no.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe must have left it behind,\u201d muttered my companion. \u201cYou didn\u2019t\nhappen to see or hear a cab after that?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a half-sovereign for you,\u201d my companion said, standing up and\ntaking his hat. \u201cI am afraid, Rance, that you will never rise in the\nforce. That head of yours should be for use as well as ornament. You\nmight have gained your sergeant\u2019s stripes last night. The man whom you\nheld in your hands is the man who holds the clue of this mystery, and\nwhom we are seeking. There is no use of arguing about it now; I tell\nyou that it is so. Come along, Doctor.\u201d\n\nWe started off for the cab together, leaving our informant incredulous,\nbut obviously uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cThe blundering fool,\u201d Holmes said, bitterly, as we drove back to our\nlodgings. \u201cJust to think of his having such an incomparable bit of good\nluck, and not taking advantage of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am rather in the dark still. It is true that the description of this\nman tallies with your idea of the second party in this mystery. But why\nshould he come back to the house after leaving it? That is not the way\nof criminals.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ring, man, the ring: that was what he came back for. If we have no\nother way of catching him, we can always bait our line with the ring. I\nshall have him, Doctor\u2014I\u2019ll lay you two to one that I have him. I must\nthank you for it all. I might not have gone but for you, and so have\nmissed the finest study I ever came across: a study in scarlet, eh? Why\nshouldn\u2019t we use a little art jargon. There\u2019s the scarlet thread of\nmurder running through the colourless skein of life, and our duty is to\nunravel it, and isolate it, and expose every inch of it. And now for\nlunch, and then for Norman Neruda. Her attack and her bowing are\nsplendid. What\u2019s that little thing of Chopin\u2019s she plays so\nmagnificently: Tra-la-la-lira-lira-lay.\u201d\n\nLeaning back in the cab, this amateur bloodhound carolled away like a\nlark while I meditated upon the many-sidedness of the human mind.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\nOUR ADVERTISEMENT BRINGS A VISITOR.\n\n\nOur morning\u2019s exertions had been too much for my weak health, and I was\ntired out in the afternoon. After Holmes\u2019 departure for the concert, I\nlay down upon the sofa and endeavoured to get a couple of hours\u2019 sleep.\nIt was a useless attempt. My mind had been too much excited by all that\nhad occurred, and the strangest fancies and surmises crowded into it.\nEvery time that I closed my eyes I saw before me the distorted\nbaboon-like countenance of the murdered man. So sinister was the\nimpression which that face had produced upon me that I found it\ndifficult to feel anything but gratitude for him who had removed its\nowner from the world. If ever human features bespoke vice of the most\nmalignant type, they were certainly those of Enoch J. Drebber, of\nCleveland. Still I recognized that justice must be done, and that the\ndepravity of the victim was no condonement in the eyes of the law.\n\nThe more I thought of it the more extraordinary did my companion\u2019s\nhypothesis, that the man had been poisoned, appear. I remembered how he\nhad sniffed his lips, and had no doubt that he had detected something\nwhich had given rise to the idea. Then, again, if not poison, what had\ncaused the man\u2019s death, since there was neither wound nor marks of\nstrangulation? But, on the other hand, whose blood was that which lay\nso thickly upon the floor? There were no signs of a struggle, nor had\nthe victim any weapon with which he might have wounded an antagonist.\nAs long as all these questions were unsolved, I felt that sleep would\nbe no easy matter, either for Holmes or myself. His quiet\nself-confident manner convinced me that he had already formed a theory\nwhich explained all the facts, though what it was I could not for an\ninstant conjecture.\n\nHe was very late in returning\u2014so late, that I knew that the concert\ncould not have detained him all the time. Dinner was on the table\nbefore he appeared.\n\n\u201cIt was magnificent,\u201d he said, as he took his seat. \u201cDo you remember\nwhat Darwin says about music? He claims that the power of producing and\nappreciating it existed among the human race long before the power of\nspeech was arrived at. Perhaps that is why we are so subtly influenced\nby it. There are vague memories in our souls of those misty centuries\nwhen the world was in its childhood.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s rather a broad idea,\u201d I remarked.\n\n\u201cOne\u2019s ideas must be as broad as Nature if they are to interpret\nNature,\u201d he answered. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? You\u2019re not looking quite\nyourself. This Brixton Road affair has upset you.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo tell the truth, it has,\u201d I said. \u201cI ought to be more case-hardened\nafter my Afghan experiences. I saw my own comrades hacked to pieces at\nMaiwand without losing my nerve.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can understand. There is a mystery about this which stimulates the\nimagination; where there is no imagination there is no horror. Have you\nseen the evening paper?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt gives a fairly good account of the affair. It does not mention the\nfact that when the man was raised up, a woman\u2019s wedding ring fell upon\nthe floor. It is just as well it does not.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at this advertisement,\u201d he answered. \u201cI had one sent to every\npaper this morning immediately after the affair.\u201d\n\nHe threw the paper across to me and I glanced at the place indicated.\nIt was the first announcement in the \u201cFound\u201d column. \u201cIn Brixton Road,\nthis morning,\u201d it ran, \u201ca plain gold wedding ring, found in the roadway\nbetween the \u2018White Hart\u2019 Tavern and Holland Grove. Apply Dr. Watson,\n221B, Baker Street, between eight and nine this evening.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcuse my using your name,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I used my own some of these\ndunderheads would recognize it, and want to meddle in the affair.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is all right,\u201d I answered. \u201cBut supposing anyone applies, I have\nno ring.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes, you have,\u201d said he, handing me one. \u201cThis will do very well.\nIt is almost a facsimile.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd who do you expect will answer this advertisement.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, the man in the brown coat\u2014our florid friend with the square toes.\nIf he does not come himself he will send an accomplice.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould he not consider it as too dangerous?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot at all. If my view of the case is correct, and I have every reason\nto believe that it is, this man would rather risk anything than lose\nthe ring. According to my notion he dropped it while stooping over\nDrebber\u2019s body, and did not miss it at the time. After leaving the\nhouse he discovered his loss and hurried back, but found the police\nalready in possession, owing to his own folly in leaving the candle\nburning. He had to pretend to be drunk in order to allay the suspicions\nwhich might have been aroused by his appearance at the gate. Now put\nyourself in that man\u2019s place. On thinking the matter over, it must have\noccurred to him that it was possible that he had lost the ring in the\nroad after leaving the house. What would he do, then? He would eagerly\nlook out for the evening papers in the hope of seeing it among the\narticles found. His eye, of course, would light upon this. He would be\noverjoyed. Why should he fear a trap? There would be no reason in his\neyes why the finding of the ring should be connected with the murder.\nHe would come. He will come. You shall see him within an hour?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cOh, you can leave me to deal with him then. Have you any arms?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have my old service revolver and a few cartridges.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou had better clean it and load it. He will be a desperate man, and\nthough I shall take him unawares, it is as well to be ready for\nanything.\u201d\n\nI went to my bedroom and followed his advice. When I returned with the\npistol the table had been cleared, and Holmes was engaged in his\nfavourite occupation of scraping upon his violin.\n\n\u201cThe plot thickens,\u201d he said, as I entered; \u201cI have just had an answer\nto my American telegram. My view of the case is the correct one.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that is?\u201d I asked eagerly.\n\n\u201cMy fiddle would be the better for new strings,\u201d he remarked. \u201cPut your\npistol in your pocket. When the fellow comes speak to him in an\nordinary way. Leave the rest to me. Don\u2019t frighten him by looking at\nhim too hard.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is eight o\u2019clock now,\u201d I said, glancing at my watch.\n\n\u201cYes. He will probably be here in a few minutes. Open the door\nslightly. That will do. Now put the key on the inside. Thank you! This\nis a queer old book I picked up at a stall yesterday\u2014\u2018De Jure inter\nGentes\u2019\u2014published in Latin at Liege in the Lowlands, in 1642. Charles\u2019\nhead was still firm on his shoulders when this little brown-backed\nvolume was struck off.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is the printer?\u201d\n\n\u201cPhilippe de Croy, whoever he may have been. On the fly-leaf, in very\nfaded ink, is written \u2018Ex libris Guliolmi Whyte.\u2019 I wonder who William\nWhyte was. Some pragmatical seventeenth century lawyer, I suppose. His\nwriting has a legal twist about it. Here comes our man, I think.\u201d\n\nAs he spoke there was a sharp ring at the bell. Sherlock Holmes rose\nsoftly and moved his chair in the direction of the door. We heard the\nservant pass along the hall, and the sharp click of the latch as she\nopened it.\n\n\u201cDoes Dr. Watson live here?\u201d asked a clear but rather harsh voice. We\ncould not hear the servant\u2019s reply, but the door closed, and some one\nbegan to ascend the stairs. The footfall was an uncertain and shuffling\none. A look of surprise passed over the face of my companion as he\nlistened to it. It came slowly along the passage, and there was a\nfeeble tap at the door.\n\n\u201cCome in,\u201d I cried.\n\nAt my summons, instead of the man of violence whom we expected, a very\nold and wrinkled woman hobbled into the apartment. She appeared to be\ndazzled by the sudden blaze of light, and after dropping a curtsey, she\nstood blinking at us with her bleared eyes and fumbling in her pocket\nwith nervous, shaky fingers. I glanced at my companion, and his face\nhad assumed such a disconsolate expression that it was all I could do\nto keep my countenance.\n\nThe old crone drew out an evening paper, and pointed at our\nadvertisement. \u201cIt\u2019s this as has brought me, good gentlemen,\u201d she said,\ndropping another curtsey; \u201ca gold wedding ring in the Brixton Road. It\nbelongs to my girl Sally, as was married only this time twelvemonth,\nwhich her husband is steward aboard a Union boat, and what he\u2019d say if\nhe come \u2018ome and found her without her ring is more than I can think,\nhe being short enough at the best o\u2019 times, but more especially when he\nhas the drink. If it please you, she went to the circus last night\nalong with\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that her ring?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cThe Lord be thanked!\u201d cried the old woman; \u201cSally will be a glad woman\nthis night. That\u2019s the ring.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what may your address be?\u201d I inquired, taking up a pencil.\n\n\u201c13, Duncan Street, Houndsditch. A weary way from here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Brixton Road does not lie between any circus and Houndsditch,\u201d\nsaid Sherlock Holmes sharply.\n\nThe old woman faced round and looked keenly at him from her little\nred-rimmed eyes. \u201cThe gentleman asked me for _my_ address,\u201d she said.\n\u201cSally lives in lodgings at 3, Mayfield Place, Peckham.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd your name is\u2014\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name is Sawyer\u2014her\u2019s is Dennis, which Tom Dennis married her\u2014and a\nsmart, clean lad, too, as long as he\u2019s at sea, and no steward in the\ncompany more thought of; but when on shore, what with the women and\nwhat with liquor shops\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHere is your ring, Mrs. Sawyer,\u201d I interrupted, in obedience to a sign\nfrom my companion; \u201cit clearly belongs to your daughter, and I am glad\nto be able to restore it to the rightful owner.\u201d\n\nWith many mumbled blessings and protestations of gratitude the old\ncrone packed it away in her pocket, and shuffled off down the stairs.\nSherlock Holmes sprang to his feet the moment that she was gone and\nrushed into his room. He returned in a few seconds enveloped in an\nulster and a cravat. \u201cI\u2019ll follow her,\u201d he said, hurriedly; \u201cshe must\nbe an accomplice, and will lead me to him. Wait up for me.\u201d The hall\ndoor had hardly slammed behind our visitor before Holmes had descended\nthe stair. Looking through the window I could see her walking feebly\nalong the other side, while her pursuer dogged her some little distance\nbehind. \u201cEither his whole theory is incorrect,\u201d I thought to myself,\n\u201cor else he will be led now to the heart of the mystery.\u201d There was no\nneed for him to ask me to wait up for him, for I felt that sleep was\nimpossible until I heard the result of his adventure.\n\nIt was close upon nine when he set out. I had no idea how long he might\nbe, but I sat stolidly puffing at my pipe and skipping over the pages\nof Henri Murger\u2019s \u201cVie de Boh\u00e8me.\u201d Ten o\u2019clock passed, and I heard the\nfootsteps of the maid as they pattered off to bed. Eleven, and the more\nstately tread of the landlady passed my door, bound for the same\ndestination. It was close upon twelve before I heard the sharp sound of\nhis latch-key. The instant he entered I saw by his face that he had not\nbeen successful. Amusement and chagrin seemed to be struggling for the\nmastery, until the former suddenly carried the day, and he burst into a\nhearty laugh.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have the Scotland Yarders know it for the world,\u201d he cried,\ndropping into his chair; \u201cI have chaffed them so much that they would\nnever have let me hear the end of it. I can afford to laugh, because I\nknow that I will be even with them in the long run.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it then?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t mind telling a story against myself. That creature had\ngone a little way when she began to limp and show every sign of being\nfoot-sore. Presently she came to a halt, and hailed a four-wheeler\nwhich was passing. I managed to be close to her so as to hear the\naddress, but I need not have been so anxious, for she sang it out loud\nenough to be heard at the other side of the street, \u2018Drive to 13,\nDuncan Street, Houndsditch,\u2019 she cried. This begins to look genuine, I\nthought, and having seen her safely inside, I perched myself behind.\nThat\u2019s an art which every detective should be an expert at. Well, away\nwe rattled, and never drew rein until we reached the street in\nquestion. I hopped off before we came to the door, and strolled down\nthe street in an easy, lounging way. I saw the cab pull up. The driver\njumped down, and I saw him open the door and stand expectantly. Nothing\ncame out though. When I reached him he was groping about frantically in\nthe empty cab, and giving vent to the finest assorted collection of\noaths that ever I listened to. There was no sign or trace of his\npassenger, and I fear it will be some time before he gets his fare. On\ninquiring at Number 13 we found that the house belonged to a\nrespectable paperhanger, named Keswick, and that no one of the name\neither of Sawyer or Dennis had ever been heard of there.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mean to say,\u201d I cried, in amazement, \u201cthat that tottering,\nfeeble old woman was able to get out of the cab while it was in motion,\nwithout either you or the driver seeing her?\u201d\n\n\u201cOld woman be damned!\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, sharply. \u201cWe were the old\nwomen to be so taken in. It must have been a young man, and an active\none, too, besides being an incomparable actor. The get-up was\ninimitable. He saw that he was followed, no doubt, and used this means\nof giving me the slip. It shows that the man we are after is not as\nlonely as I imagined he was, but has friends who are ready to risk\nsomething for him. Now, Doctor, you are looking done-up. Take my advice\nand turn in.\u201d\n\nI was certainly feeling very weary, so I obeyed his injunction. I left\nHolmes seated in front of the smouldering fire, and long into the\nwatches of the night I heard the low, melancholy wailings of his\nviolin, and knew that he was still pondering over the strange problem\nwhich he had set himself to unravel.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\nTOBIAS GREGSON SHOWS WHAT HE CAN DO.\n\n\nThe papers next day were full of the \u201cBrixton Mystery,\u201d as they termed\nit. Each had a long account of the affair, and some had leaders upon it\nin addition. There was some information in them which was new to me. I\nstill retain in my scrap-book numerous clippings and extracts bearing\nupon the case. Here is a condensation of a few of them:\u2014\n\nThe _Daily Telegraph_ remarked that in the history of crime there had\nseldom been a tragedy which presented stranger features. The German\nname of the victim, the absence of all other motive, and the sinister\ninscription on the wall, all pointed to its perpetration by political\nrefugees and revolutionists. The Socialists had many branches in\nAmerica, and the deceased had, no doubt, infringed their unwritten\nlaws, and been tracked down by them. After alluding airily to the\nVehmgericht, aqua tofana, Carbonari, the Marchioness de Brinvilliers,\nthe Darwinian theory, the principles of Malthus, and the Ratcliff\nHighway murders, the article concluded by admonishing the Government\nand advocating a closer watch over foreigners in England.\n\nThe _Standard_ commented upon the fact that lawless outrages of the\nsort usually occurred under a Liberal Administration. They arose from\nthe unsettling of the minds of the masses, and the consequent weakening\nof all authority. The deceased was an American gentleman who had been\nresiding for some weeks in the Metropolis. He had stayed at the\nboarding-house of Madame Charpentier, in Torquay Terrace, Camberwell.\nHe was accompanied in his travels by his private secretary, Mr. Joseph\nStangerson. The two bade adieu to their landlady upon Tuesday, the 4th\ninst., and departed to Euston Station with the avowed intention of\ncatching the Liverpool express. They were afterwards seen together upon\nthe platform. Nothing more is known of them until Mr. Drebber\u2019s body\nwas, as recorded, discovered in an empty house in the Brixton Road,\nmany miles from Euston. How he came there, or how he met his fate, are\nquestions which are still involved in mystery. Nothing is known of the\nwhereabouts of Stangerson. We are glad to learn that Mr. Lestrade and\nMr. Gregson, of Scotland Yard, are both engaged upon the case, and it\nis confidently anticipated that these well-known officers will speedily\nthrow light upon the matter.\n\nThe _Daily News_ observed that there was no doubt as to the crime being\na political one. The despotism and hatred of Liberalism which animated\nthe Continental Governments had had the effect of driving to our shores\na number of men who might have made excellent citizens were they not\nsoured by the recollection of all that they had undergone. Among these\nmen there was a stringent code of honour, any infringement of which was\npunished by death. Every effort should be made to find the secretary,\nStangerson, and to ascertain some particulars of the habits of the\ndeceased. A great step had been gained by the discovery of the address\nof the house at which he had boarded\u2014a result which was entirely due to\nthe acuteness and energy of Mr. Gregson of Scotland Yard.\n\nSherlock Holmes and I read these notices over together at breakfast,\nand they appeared to afford him considerable amusement.\n\n\u201cI told you that, whatever happened, Lestrade and Gregson would be sure\nto score.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat depends on how it turns out.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, bless you, it doesn\u2019t matter in the least. If the man is caught,\nit will be _on account_ of their exertions; if he escapes, it will be\n_in spite_ of their exertions. It\u2019s heads I win and tails you lose.\nWhatever they do, they will have followers. \u2018Un sot trouve toujours un\nplus sot qui l\u2019admire.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat on earth is this?\u201d I cried, for at this moment there came the\npattering of many steps in the hall and on the stairs, accompanied by\naudible expressions of disgust upon the part of our landlady.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Baker Street division of the detective police force,\u201d said my\ncompanion, gravely; and as he spoke there rushed into the room half a\ndozen of the dirtiest and most ragged street Arabs that ever I clapped\neyes on.\n\n\u201c\u2018Tention!\u201d cried Holmes, in a sharp tone, and the six dirty little\nscoundrels stood in a line like so many disreputable statuettes. \u201cIn\nfuture you shall send up Wiggins alone to report, and the rest of you\nmust wait in the street. Have you found it, Wiggins?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, sir, we hain\u2019t,\u201d said one of the youths.\n\n\u201cI hardly expected you would. You must keep on until you do. Here are\nyour wages.\u201d He handed each of them a shilling.\n\n\u201cNow, off you go, and come back with a better report next time.\u201d\n\nHe waved his hand, and they scampered away downstairs like so many\nrats, and we heard their shrill voices next moment in the street.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more work to be got out of one of those little beggars than\nout of a dozen of the force,\u201d Holmes remarked. \u201cThe mere sight of an\nofficial-looking person seals men\u2019s lips. These youngsters, however, go\neverywhere and hear everything. They are as sharp as needles, too; all\nthey want is organisation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it on this Brixton case that you are employing them?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cYes; there is a point which I wish to ascertain. It is merely a matter\nof time. Hullo! we are going to hear some news now with a vengeance!\nHere is Gregson coming down the road with beatitude written upon every\nfeature of his face. Bound for us, I know. Yes, he is stopping. There\nhe is!\u201d\n\nThere was a violent peal at the bell, and in a few seconds the\nfair-haired detective came up the stairs, three steps at a time, and\nburst into our sitting-room.\n\n\u201cMy dear fellow,\u201d he cried, wringing Holmes\u2019 unresponsive hand,\n\u201ccongratulate me! I have made the whole thing as clear as day.\u201d\n\nA shade of anxiety seemed to me to cross my companion\u2019s expressive\nface.\n\n\u201cDo you mean that you are on the right track?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cThe right track! Why, sir, we have the man under lock and key.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd his name is?\u201d\n\n\u201cArthur Charpentier, sub-lieutenant in Her Majesty\u2019s navy,\u201d cried\nGregson, pompously, rubbing his fat hands and inflating his chest.\n\nSherlock Holmes gave a sigh of relief, and relaxed into a smile.\n\n\u201cTake a seat, and try one of these cigars,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are anxious to\nknow how you managed it. Will you have some whiskey and water?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind if I do,\u201d the detective answered. \u201cThe tremendous\nexertions which I have gone through during the last day or two have\nworn me out. Not so much bodily exertion, you understand, as the strain\nupon the mind. You will appreciate that, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for we\nare both brain-workers.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do me too much honour,\u201d said Holmes, gravely. \u201cLet us hear how you\narrived at this most gratifying result.\u201d\n\nThe detective seated himself in the arm-chair, and puffed complacently\nat his cigar. Then suddenly he slapped his thigh in a paroxysm of\namusement.\n\n\u201cThe fun of it is,\u201d he cried, \u201cthat that fool Lestrade, who thinks\nhimself so smart, has gone off upon the wrong track altogether. He is\nafter the secretary Stangerson, who had no more to do with the crime\nthan the babe unborn. I have no doubt that he has caught him by this\ntime.\u201d\n\nThe idea tickled Gregson so much that he laughed until he choked.\n\n\u201cAnd how did you get your clue?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, I\u2019ll tell you all about it. Of course, Doctor Watson, this is\nstrictly between ourselves. The first difficulty which we had to\ncontend with was the finding of this American\u2019s antecedents. Some\npeople would have waited until their advertisements were answered, or\nuntil parties came forward and volunteered information. That is not\nTobias Gregson\u2019s way of going to work. You remember the hat beside the\ndead man?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Holmes; \u201cby John Underwood and Sons, 129, Camberwell Road.\u201d\n\nGregson looked quite crest-fallen.\n\n\u201cI had no idea that you noticed that,\u201d he said. \u201cHave you been there?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cHa!\u201d cried Gregson, in a relieved voice; \u201cyou should never neglect a\nchance, however small it may seem.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo a great mind, nothing is little,\u201d remarked Holmes, sententiously.\n\n\u201cWell, I went to Underwood, and asked him if he had sold a hat of that\nsize and description. He looked over his books, and came on it at once.\nHe had sent the hat to a Mr. Drebber, residing at Charpentier\u2019s\nBoarding Establishment, Torquay Terrace. Thus I got at his address.\u201d\n\n\u201cSmart\u2014very smart!\u201d murmured Sherlock Holmes.\n\n\u201cI next called upon Madame Charpentier,\u201d continued the detective. \u201cI\nfound her very pale and distressed. Her daughter was in the room,\ntoo\u2014an uncommonly fine girl she is, too; she was looking red about the\neyes and her lips trembled as I spoke to her. That didn\u2019t escape my\nnotice. I began to smell a rat. You know the feeling, Mr. Sherlock\nHolmes, when you come upon the right scent\u2014a kind of thrill in your\nnerves. \u2018Have you heard of the mysterious death of your late boarder\nMr. Enoch J. Drebber, of Cleveland?\u2019 I asked.\n\n\u201cThe mother nodded. She didn\u2019t seem able to get out a word. The\ndaughter burst into tears. I felt more than ever that these people knew\nsomething of the matter.\n\n\u201c\u2018At what o\u2019clock did Mr. Drebber leave your house for the train?\u2019 I\nasked.\n\n\u201c\u2018At eight o\u2019clock,\u2019 she said, gulping in her throat to keep down her\nagitation. \u2018His secretary, Mr. Stangerson, said that there were two\ntrains\u2014one at 9.15 and one at 11. He was to catch the first.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018And was that the last which you saw of him?\u2019\n\n\u201cA terrible change came over the woman\u2019s face as I asked the question.\nHer features turned perfectly livid. It was some seconds before she\ncould get out the single word \u2018Yes\u2019\u2014and when it did come it was in a\nhusky unnatural tone.\n\n\u201cThere was silence for a moment, and then the daughter spoke in a calm\nclear voice.\n\n\u201c\u2018No good can ever come of falsehood, mother,\u2019 she said. \u2018Let us be\nfrank with this gentleman. We _did_ see Mr. Drebber again.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018God forgive you!\u2019 cried Madame Charpentier, throwing up her hands and\nsinking back in her chair. \u2018You have murdered your brother.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Arthur would rather that we spoke the truth,\u2019 the girl answered\nfirmly.\n\n\u201c\u2018You had best tell me all about it now,\u2019 I said. \u2018Half-confidences are\nworse than none. Besides, you do not know how much we know of it.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018On your head be it, Alice!\u2019 cried her mother; and then, turning to\nme, \u2018I will tell you all, sir. Do not imagine that my agitation on\nbehalf of my son arises from any fear lest he should have had a hand in\nthis terrible affair. He is utterly innocent of it. My dread is,\nhowever, that in your eyes and in the eyes of others he may appear to\nbe compromised. That however is surely impossible. His high character,\nhis profession, his antecedents would all forbid it.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Your best way is to make a clean breast of the facts,\u2019 I answered.\n\u2018Depend upon it, if your son is innocent he will be none the worse.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Perhaps, Alice, you had better leave us together,\u2019 she said, and her\ndaughter withdrew. \u2018Now, sir,\u2019 she continued, \u2018I had no intention of\ntelling you all this, but since my poor daughter has disclosed it I\nhave no alternative. Having once decided to speak, I will tell you all\nwithout omitting any particular.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018It is your wisest course,\u2019 said I.\n\n\u201c\u2018Mr. Drebber has been with us nearly three weeks. He and his\nsecretary, Mr. Stangerson, had been travelling on the Continent. I\nnoticed a \u201cCopenhagen\u201d label upon each of their trunks, showing that\nthat had been their last stopping place. Stangerson was a quiet\nreserved man, but his employer, I am sorry to say, was far otherwise.\nHe was coarse in his habits and brutish in his ways. The very night of\nhis arrival he became very much the worse for drink, and, indeed, after\ntwelve o\u2019clock in the day he could hardly ever be said to be sober. His\nmanners towards the maid-servants were disgustingly free and familiar.\nWorst of all, he speedily assumed the same attitude towards my\ndaughter, Alice, and spoke to her more than once in a way which,\nfortunately, she is too innocent to understand. On one occasion he\nactually seized her in his arms and embraced her\u2014an outrage which\ncaused his own secretary to reproach him for his unmanly conduct.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018But why did you stand all this,\u2019 I asked. \u2018I suppose that you can get\nrid of your boarders when you wish.\u2019\n\n\u201cMrs. Charpentier blushed at my pertinent question. \u2018Would to God that\nI had given him notice on the very day that he came,\u2019 she said. \u2018But it\nwas a sore temptation. They were paying a pound a day each\u2014fourteen\npounds a week, and this is the slack season. I am a widow, and my boy\nin the Navy has cost me much. I grudged to lose the money. I acted for\nthe best. This last was too much, however, and I gave him notice to\nleave on account of it. That was the reason of his going.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Well?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018My heart grew light when I saw him drive away. My son is on leave\njust now, but I did not tell him anything of all this, for his temper\nis violent, and he is passionately fond of his sister. When I closed\nthe door behind them a load seemed to be lifted from my mind. Alas, in\nless than an hour there was a ring at the bell, and I learned that Mr.\nDrebber had returned. He was much excited, and evidently the worse for\ndrink. He forced his way into the room, where I was sitting with my\ndaughter, and made some incoherent remark about having missed his\ntrain. He then turned to Alice, and before my very face, proposed to\nher that she should fly with him. \u201cYou are of age,\u201d he said, \u201cand there\nis no law to stop you. I have money enough and to spare. Never mind the\nold girl here, but come along with me now straight away. You shall live\nlike a princess.\u201d Poor Alice was so frightened that she shrunk away\nfrom him, but he caught her by the wrist and endeavoured to draw her\ntowards the door. I screamed, and at that moment my son Arthur came\ninto the room. What happened then I do not know. I heard oaths and the\nconfused sounds of a scuffle. I was too terrified to raise my head.\nWhen I did look up I saw Arthur standing in the doorway laughing, with\na stick in his hand. \u201cI don\u2019t think that fine fellow will trouble us\nagain,\u201d he said. \u201cI will just go after him and see what he does with\nhimself.\u201d With those words he took his hat and started off down the\nstreet. The next morning we heard of Mr. Drebber\u2019s mysterious death.\u2019\n\n\u201cThis statement came from Mrs. Charpentier\u2019s lips with many gasps and\npauses. At times she spoke so low that I could hardly catch the words.\nI made shorthand notes of all that she said, however, so that there\nshould be no possibility of a mistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite exciting,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, with a yawn. \u201cWhat\nhappened next?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen Mrs. Charpentier paused,\u201d the detective continued, \u201cI saw that\nthe whole case hung upon one point. Fixing her with my eye in a way\nwhich I always found effective with women, I asked her at what hour her\nson returned.\n\n\u201c\u2018I do not know,\u2019 she answered.\n\n\u201c\u2018Not know?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018No; he has a latch-key, and he let himself in.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018After you went to bed?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018When did you go to bed?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018About eleven.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018So your son was gone at least two hours?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Possibly four or five?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018What was he doing during that time?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018I do not know,\u2019 she answered, turning white to her very lips.\n\n\u201cOf course after that there was nothing more to be done. I found out\nwhere Lieutenant Charpentier was, took two officers with me, and\narrested him. When I touched him on the shoulder and warned him to come\nquietly with us, he answered us as bold as brass, \u2018I suppose you are\narresting me for being concerned in the death of that scoundrel\nDrebber,\u2019 he said. We had said nothing to him about it, so that his\nalluding to it had a most suspicious aspect.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery,\u201d said Holmes.\n\n\u201cHe still carried the heavy stick which the mother described him as\nhaving with him when he followed Drebber. It was a stout oak cudgel.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is your theory, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, my theory is that he followed Drebber as far as the Brixton\nRoad. When there, a fresh altercation arose between them, in the course\nof which Drebber received a blow from the stick, in the pit of the\nstomach, perhaps, which killed him without leaving any mark. The night\nwas so wet that no one was about, so Charpentier dragged the body of\nhis victim into the empty house. As to the candle, and the blood, and\nthe writing on the wall, and the ring, they may all be so many tricks\nto throw the police on to the wrong scent.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell done!\u201d said Holmes in an encouraging voice. \u201cReally, Gregson, you\nare getting along. We shall make something of you yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI flatter myself that I have managed it rather neatly,\u201d the detective\nanswered proudly. \u201cThe young man volunteered a statement, in which he\nsaid that after following Drebber some time, the latter perceived him,\nand took a cab in order to get away from him. On his way home he met an\nold shipmate, and took a long walk with him. On being asked where this\nold shipmate lived, he was unable to give any satisfactory reply. I\nthink the whole case fits together uncommonly well. What amuses me is\nto think of Lestrade, who had started off upon the wrong scent. I am\nafraid he won\u2019t make much of it. Why, by Jove, here\u2019s the very man\nhimself!\u201d\n\nIt was indeed Lestrade, who had ascended the stairs while we were\ntalking, and who now entered the room. The assurance and jauntiness\nwhich generally marked his demeanour and dress were, however, wanting.\nHis face was disturbed and troubled, while his clothes were disarranged\nand untidy. He had evidently come with the intention of consulting with\nSherlock Holmes, for on perceiving his colleague he appeared to be\nembarrassed and put out. He stood in the centre of the room, fumbling\nnervously with his hat and uncertain what to do. \u201cThis is a most\nextraordinary case,\u201d he said at last\u2014\u201ca most incomprehensible affair.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, you find it so, Mr. Lestrade!\u201d cried Gregson, triumphantly. \u201cI\nthought you would come to that conclusion. Have you managed to find the\nSecretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson,\u201d said Lestrade gravely, \u201cwas\nmurdered at Halliday\u2019s Private Hotel about six o\u2019clock this morning.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\nLIGHT IN THE DARKNESS.\n\n\nThe intelligence with which Lestrade greeted us was so momentous and so\nunexpected, that we were all three fairly dumfoundered. Gregson sprang\nout of his chair and upset the remainder of his whiskey and water. I\nstared in silence at Sherlock Holmes, whose lips were compressed and\nhis brows drawn down over his eyes.\n\n\u201cStangerson too!\u201d he muttered. \u201cThe plot thickens.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was quite thick enough before,\u201d grumbled Lestrade, taking a chair.\n\u201cI seem to have dropped into a sort of council of war.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you\u2014are you sure of this piece of intelligence?\u201d stammered\nGregson.\n\n\u201cI have just come from his room,\u201d said Lestrade. \u201cI was the first to\ndiscover what had occurred.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have been hearing Gregson\u2019s view of the matter,\u201d Holmes observed.\n\u201cWould you mind letting us know what you have seen and done?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no objection,\u201d Lestrade answered, seating himself. \u201cI freely\nconfess that I was of the opinion that Stangerson was concerned in the\ndeath of Drebber. This fresh development has shown me that I was\ncompletely mistaken. Full of the one idea, I set myself to find out\nwhat had become of the Secretary. They had been seen together at Euston\nStation about half-past eight on the evening of the third. At two in\nthe morning Drebber had been found in the Brixton Road. The question\nwhich confronted me was to find out how Stangerson had been employed\nbetween 8.30 and the time of the crime, and what had become of him\nafterwards. I telegraphed to Liverpool, giving a description of the\nman, and warning them to keep a watch upon the American boats. I then\nset to work calling upon all the hotels and lodging-houses in the\nvicinity of Euston. You see, I argued that if Drebber and his companion\nhad become separated, the natural course for the latter would be to put\nup somewhere in the vicinity for the night, and then to hang about the\nstation again next morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey would be likely to agree on some meeting-place beforehand,\u201d\nremarked Holmes.\n\n\u201cSo it proved. I spent the whole of yesterday evening in making\nenquiries entirely without avail. This morning I began very early, and\nat eight o\u2019clock I reached Halliday\u2019s Private Hotel, in Little George\nStreet. On my enquiry as to whether a Mr. Stangerson was living there,\nthey at once answered me in the affirmative.\n\n\u201c\u2018No doubt you are the gentleman whom he was expecting,\u2019 they said. \u2018He\nhas been waiting for a gentleman for two days.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Where is he now?\u2019 I asked.\n\n\u201c\u2018He is upstairs in bed. He wished to be called at nine.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018I will go up and see him at once,\u2019 I said.\n\n\u201cIt seemed to me that my sudden appearance might shake his nerves and\nlead him to say something unguarded. The Boots volunteered to show me\nthe room: it was on the second floor, and there was a small corridor\nleading up to it. The Boots pointed out the door to me, and was about\nto go downstairs again when I saw something that made me feel sickish,\nin spite of my twenty years\u2019 experience. From under the door there\ncurled a little red ribbon of blood, which had meandered across the\npassage and formed a little pool along the skirting at the other side.\nI gave a cry, which brought the Boots back. He nearly fainted when he\nsaw it. The door was locked on the inside, but we put our shoulders to\nit, and knocked it in. The window of the room was open, and beside the\nwindow, all huddled up, lay the body of a man in his nightdress. He was\nquite dead, and had been for some time, for his limbs were rigid and\ncold. When we turned him over, the Boots recognized him at once as\nbeing the same gentleman who had engaged the room under the name of\nJoseph Stangerson. The cause of death was a deep stab in the left side,\nwhich must have penetrated the heart. And now comes the strangest part\nof the affair. What do you suppose was above the murdered man?\u201d\n\nI felt a creeping of the flesh, and a presentiment of coming horror,\neven before Sherlock Holmes answered.\n\n\u201cThe word RACHE, written in letters of blood,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat was it,\u201d said Lestrade, in an awe-struck voice; and we were all\nsilent for a while.\n\nThere was something so methodical and so incomprehensible about the\ndeeds of this unknown assassin, that it imparted a fresh ghastliness to\nhis crimes. My nerves, which were steady enough on the field of battle\ntingled as I thought of it.\n\n\u201cThe man was seen,\u201d continued Lestrade. \u201cA milk boy, passing on his way\nto the dairy, happened to walk down the lane which leads from the mews\nat the back of the hotel. He noticed that a ladder, which usually lay\nthere, was raised against one of the windows of the second floor, which\nwas wide open. After passing, he looked back and saw a man descend the\nladder. He came down so quietly and openly that the boy imagined him to\nbe some carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel. He took no particular\nnotice of him, beyond thinking in his own mind that it was early for\nhim to be at work. He has an impression that the man was tall, had a\nreddish face, and was dressed in a long, brownish coat. He must have\nstayed in the room some little time after the murder, for we found\nblood-stained water in the basin, where he had washed his hands, and\nmarks on the sheets where he had deliberately wiped his knife.\u201d\n\nI glanced at Holmes on hearing the description of the murderer, which\ntallied so exactly with his own. There was, however, no trace of\nexultation or satisfaction upon his face.\n\n\u201cDid you find nothing in the room which could furnish a clue to the\nmurderer?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cNothing. Stangerson had Drebber\u2019s purse in his pocket, but it seems\nthat this was usual, as he did all the paying. There was eighty odd\npounds in it, but nothing had been taken. Whatever the motives of these\nextraordinary crimes, robbery is certainly not one of them. There were\nno papers or memoranda in the murdered man\u2019s pocket, except a single\ntelegram, dated from Cleveland about a month ago, and containing the\nwords, \u2018J. H. is in Europe.\u2019 There was no name appended to this\nmessage.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd there was nothing else?\u201d Holmes asked.\n\n\u201cNothing of any importance. The man\u2019s novel, with which he had read\nhimself to sleep was lying upon the bed, and his pipe was on a chair\nbeside him. There was a glass of water on the table, and on the\nwindow-sill a small chip ointment box containing a couple of pills.\u201d\n\nSherlock Holmes sprang from his chair with an exclamation of delight.\n\n\u201cThe last link,\u201d he cried, exultantly. \u201cMy case is complete.\u201d\n\nThe two detectives stared at him in amazement.\n\n\u201cI have now in my hands,\u201d my companion said, confidently, \u201call the\nthreads which have formed such a tangle. There are, of course, details\nto be filled in, but I am as certain of all the main facts, from the\ntime that Drebber parted from Stangerson at the station, up to the\ndiscovery of the body of the latter, as if I had seen them with my own\neyes. I will give you a proof of my knowledge. Could you lay your hand\nupon those pills?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have them,\u201d said Lestrade, producing a small white box; \u201cI took them\nand the purse and the telegram, intending to have them put in a place\nof safety at the Police Station. It was the merest chance my taking\nthese pills, for I am bound to say that I do not attach any importance\nto them.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive them here,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cNow, Doctor,\u201d turning to me, \u201care those\nordinary pills?\u201d\n\nThey certainly were not. They were of a pearly grey colour, small,\nround, and almost transparent against the light. \u201cFrom their lightness\nand transparency, I should imagine that they are soluble in water,\u201d I\nremarked.\n\n\u201cPrecisely so,\u201d answered Holmes. \u201cNow would you mind going down and\nfetching that poor little devil of a terrier which has been bad so\nlong, and which the landlady wanted you to put out of its pain\nyesterday.\u201d\n\nI went downstairs and carried the dog upstairs in my arms. Its laboured\nbreathing and glazing eye showed that it was not far from its end.\nIndeed, its snow-white muzzle proclaimed that it had already exceeded\nthe usual term of canine existence. I placed it upon a cushion on the\nrug.\n\n\u201cI will now cut one of these pills in two,\u201d said Holmes, and drawing\nhis penknife he suited the action to the word. \u201cOne half we return into\nthe box for future purposes. The other half I will place in this wine\nglass, in which is a teaspoonful of water. You perceive that our\nfriend, the Doctor, is right, and that it readily dissolves.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis may be very interesting,\u201d said Lestrade, in the injured tone of\none who suspects that he is being laughed at, \u201cI cannot see, however,\nwhat it has to do with the death of Mr. Joseph Stangerson.\u201d\n\n\u201cPatience, my friend, patience! You will find in time that it has\neverything to do with it. I shall now add a little milk to make the\nmixture palatable, and on presenting it to the dog we find that he laps\nit up readily enough.\u201d\n\nAs he spoke he turned the contents of the wine glass into a saucer and\nplaced it in front of the terrier, who speedily licked it dry. Sherlock\nHolmes\u2019 earnest demeanour had so far convinced us that we all sat in\nsilence, watching the animal intently, and expecting some startling\neffect. None such appeared, however. The dog continued to lie stretched\nupon the cushion, breathing in a laboured way, but apparently neither\nthe better nor the worse for its draught.\n\nHolmes had taken out his watch, and as minute followed minute without\nresult, an expression of the utmost chagrin and disappointment appeared\nupon his features. He gnawed his lip, drummed his fingers upon the\ntable, and showed every other symptom of acute impatience. So great was\nhis emotion, that I felt sincerely sorry for him, while the two\ndetectives smiled derisively, by no means displeased at this check\nwhich he had met.\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be a coincidence,\u201d he cried, at last springing from his chair\nand pacing wildly up and down the room; \u201cit is impossible that it\nshould be a mere coincidence. The very pills which I suspected in the\ncase of Drebber are actually found after the death of Stangerson. And\nyet they are inert. What can it mean? Surely my whole chain of\nreasoning cannot have been false. It is impossible! And yet this\nwretched dog is none the worse. Ah, I have it! I have it!\u201d With a\nperfect shriek of delight he rushed to the box, cut the other pill in\ntwo, dissolved it, added milk, and presented it to the terrier. The\nunfortunate creature\u2019s tongue seemed hardly to have been moistened in\nit before it gave a convulsive shiver in every limb, and lay as rigid\nand lifeless as if it had been struck by lightning.\n\nSherlock Holmes drew a long breath, and wiped the perspiration from his\nforehead. \u201cI should have more faith,\u201d he said; \u201cI ought to know by this\ntime that when a fact appears to be opposed to a long train of\ndeductions, it invariably proves to be capable of bearing some other\ninterpretation. Of the two pills in that box one was of the most deadly\npoison, and the other was entirely harmless. I ought to have known that\nbefore ever I saw the box at all.\u201d\n\nThis last statement appeared to me to be so startling, that I could\nhardly believe that he was in his sober senses. There was the dead dog,\nhowever, to prove that his conjecture had been correct. It seemed to me\nthat the mists in my own mind were gradually clearing away, and I began\nto have a dim, vague perception of the truth.\n\n\u201cAll this seems strange to you,\u201d continued Holmes, \u201cbecause you failed\nat the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single\nreal clue which was presented to you. I had the good fortune to seize\nupon that, and everything which has occurred since then has served to\nconfirm my original supposition, and, indeed, was the logical sequence\nof it. Hence things which have perplexed you and made the case more\nobscure, have served to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions.\nIt is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery. The most\ncommonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it presents no\nnew or special features from which deductions may be drawn. This murder\nwould have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of\nthe victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of those\n_outr\u00e9_ and sensational accompaniments which have rendered it\nremarkable. These strange details, far from making the case more\ndifficult, have really had the effect of making it less so.\u201d\n\nMr. Gregson, who had listened to this address with considerable\nimpatience, could contain himself no longer. \u201cLook here, Mr. Sherlock\nHolmes,\u201d he said, \u201cwe are all ready to acknowledge that you are a smart\nman, and that you have your own methods of working. We want something\nmore than mere theory and preaching now, though. It is a case of taking\nthe man. I have made my case out, and it seems I was wrong. Young\nCharpentier could not have been engaged in this second affair. Lestrade\nwent after his man, Stangerson, and it appears that he was wrong too.\nYou have thrown out hints here, and hints there, and seem to know more\nthan we do, but the time has come when we feel that we have a right to\nask you straight how much you do know of the business. Can you name the\nman who did it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot help feeling that Gregson is right, sir,\u201d remarked Lestrade.\n\u201cWe have both tried, and we have both failed. You have remarked more\nthan once since I have been in the room that you had all the evidence\nwhich you require. Surely you will not withhold it any longer.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny delay in arresting the assassin,\u201d I observed, \u201cmight give him time\nto perpetrate some fresh atrocity.\u201d\n\nThus pressed by us all, Holmes showed signs of irresolution. He\ncontinued to walk up and down the room with his head sunk on his chest\nand his brows drawn down, as was his habit when lost in thought.\n\n\u201cThere will be no more murders,\u201d he said at last, stopping abruptly and\nfacing us. \u201cYou can put that consideration out of the question. You\nhave asked me if I know the name of the assassin. I do. The mere\nknowing of his name is a small thing, however, compared with the power\nof laying our hands upon him. This I expect very shortly to do. I have\ngood hopes of managing it through my own arrangements; but it is a\nthing which needs delicate handling, for we have a shrewd and desperate\nman to deal with, who is supported, as I have had occasion to prove, by\nanother who is as clever as himself. As long as this man has no idea\nthat anyone can have a clue there is some chance of securing him; but\nif he had the slightest suspicion, he would change his name, and vanish\nin an instant among the four million inhabitants of this great city.\nWithout meaning to hurt either of your feelings, I am bound to say that\nI consider these men to be more than a match for the official force,\nand that is why I have not asked your assistance. If I fail I shall, of\ncourse, incur all the blame due to this omission; but that I am\nprepared for. At present I am ready to promise that the instant that I\ncan communicate with you without endangering my own combinations, I\nshall do so.\u201d\n\nGregson and Lestrade seemed to be far from satisfied by this assurance,\nor by the depreciating allusion to the detective police. The former had\nflushed up to the roots of his flaxen hair, while the other\u2019s beady\neyes glistened with curiosity and resentment. Neither of them had time\nto speak, however, before there was a tap at the door, and the\nspokesman of the street Arabs, young Wiggins, introduced his\ninsignificant and unsavoury person.\n\n\u201cPlease, sir,\u201d he said, touching his forelock, \u201cI have the cab\ndownstairs.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood boy,\u201d said Holmes, blandly. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you introduce this pattern\nat Scotland Yard?\u201d he continued, taking a pair of steel handcuffs from\na drawer. \u201cSee how beautifully the spring works. They fasten in an\ninstant.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe old pattern is good enough,\u201d remarked Lestrade, \u201cif we can only\nfind the man to put them on.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery good, very good,\u201d said Holmes, smiling. \u201cThe cabman may as well\nhelp me with my boxes. Just ask him to step up, Wiggins.\u201d\n\nI was surprised to find my companion speaking as though he were about\nto set out on a journey, since he had not said anything to me about it.\nThere was a small portmanteau in the room, and this he pulled out and\nbegan to strap. He was busily engaged at it when the cabman entered the\nroom.\n\n\u201cJust give me a help with this buckle, cabman,\u201d he said, kneeling over\nhis task, and never turning his head.\n\nThe fellow came forward with a somewhat sullen, defiant air, and put\ndown his hands to assist. At that instant there was a sharp click, the\njangling of metal, and Sherlock Holmes sprang to his feet again.\n\n\u201cGentlemen,\u201d he cried, with flashing eyes, \u201clet me introduce you to Mr.\nJefferson Hope, the murderer of Enoch Drebber and of Joseph\nStangerson.\u201d\n\nThe whole thing occurred in a moment\u2014so quickly that I had no time to\nrealize it. I have a vivid recollection of that instant, of Holmes\u2019\ntriumphant expression and the ring of his voice, of the cabman\u2019s dazed,\nsavage face, as he glared at the glittering handcuffs, which had\nappeared as if by magic upon his wrists. For a second or two we might\nhave been a group of statues. Then, with an inarticulate roar of fury,\nthe prisoner wrenched himself free from Holmes\u2019s grasp, and hurled\nhimself through the window. Woodwork and glass gave way before him; but\nbefore he got quite through, Gregson, Lestrade, and Holmes sprang upon\nhim like so many staghounds. He was dragged back into the room, and\nthen commenced a terrific conflict. So powerful and so fierce was he,\nthat the four of us were shaken off again and again. He appeared to\nhave the convulsive strength of a man in an epileptic fit. His face and\nhands were terribly mangled by his passage through the glass, but loss\nof blood had no effect in diminishing his resistance. It was not until\nLestrade succeeded in getting his hand inside his neckcloth and\nhalf-strangling him that we made him realize that his struggles were of\nno avail; and even then we felt no security until we had pinioned his\nfeet as well as his hands. That done, we rose to our feet breathless\nand panting.\n\n\u201cWe have his cab,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes. \u201cIt will serve to take him to\nScotland Yard. And now, gentlemen,\u201d he continued, with a pleasant\nsmile, \u201cwe have reached the end of our little mystery. You are very\nwelcome to put any questions that you like to me now, and there is no\ndanger that I will refuse to answer them.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nPART II.\n_The Country of the Saints._\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\nON THE GREAT ALKALI PLAIN.\n\n\nIn the central portion of the great North American Continent there lies\nan arid and repulsive desert, which for many a long year served as a\nbarrier against the advance of civilisation. From the Sierra Nevada to\nNebraska, and from the Yellowstone River in the north to the Colorado\nupon the south, is a region of desolation and silence. Nor is Nature\nalways in one mood throughout this grim district. It comprises\nsnow-capped and lofty mountains, and dark and gloomy valleys. There are\nswift-flowing rivers which dash through jagged ca\u00f1ons; and there are\nenormous plains, which in winter are white with snow, and in summer are\ngrey with the saline alkali dust. They all preserve, however, the\ncommon characteristics of barrenness, inhospitality, and misery.\n\nThere are no inhabitants of this land of despair. A band of Pawnees or\nof Blackfeet may occasionally traverse it in order to reach other\nhunting-grounds, but the hardiest of the braves are glad to lose sight\nof those awesome plains, and to find themselves once more upon their\nprairies. The coyote skulks among the scrub, the buzzard flaps heavily\nthrough the air, and the clumsy grizzly bear lumbers through the dark\nravines, and picks up such sustenance as it can amongst the rocks.\nThese are the sole dwellers in the wilderness.\n\nIn the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from the\nnorthern slope of the Sierra Blanco. As far as the eye can reach\nstretches the great flat plain-land, all dusted over with patches of\nalkali, and intersected by clumps of the dwarfish chaparral bushes. On\nthe extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain peaks,\nwith their rugged summits flecked with snow. In this great stretch of\ncountry there is no sign of life, nor of anything appertaining to life.\nThere is no bird in the steel-blue heaven, no movement upon the dull,\ngrey earth\u2014above all, there is absolute silence. Listen as one may,\nthere is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness; nothing\nbut silence\u2014complete and heart-subduing silence.\n\nIt has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad\nplain. That is hardly true. Looking down from the Sierra Blanco, one\nsees a pathway traced out across the desert, which winds away and is\nlost in the extreme distance. It is rutted with wheels and trodden down\nby the feet of many adventurers. Here and there there are scattered\nwhite objects which glisten in the sun, and stand out against the dull\ndeposit of alkali. Approach, and examine them! They are bones: some\nlarge and coarse, others smaller and more delicate. The former have\nbelonged to oxen, and the latter to men. For fifteen hundred miles one\nmay trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of\nthose who had fallen by the wayside.\n\nLooking down on this very scene, there stood upon the fourth of May,\neighteen hundred and forty-seven, a solitary traveller. His appearance\nwas such that he might have been the very genius or demon of the\nregion. An observer would have found it difficult to say whether he was\nnearer to forty or to sixty. His face was lean and haggard, and the\nbrown parchment-like skin was drawn tightly over the projecting bones;\nhis long, brown hair and beard were all flecked and dashed with white;\nhis eyes were sunken in his head, and burned with an unnatural lustre;\nwhile the hand which grasped his rifle was hardly more fleshy than that\nof a skeleton. As he stood, he leaned upon his weapon for support, and\nyet his tall figure and the massive framework of his bones suggested a\nwiry and vigorous constitution. His gaunt face, however, and his\nclothes, which hung so baggily over his shrivelled limbs, proclaimed\nwhat it was that gave him that senile and decrepit appearance. The man\nwas dying\u2014dying from hunger and from thirst.\n\nHe had toiled painfully down the ravine, and on to this little\nelevation, in the vain hope of seeing some signs of water. Now the\ngreat salt plain stretched before his eyes, and the distant belt of\nsavage mountains, without a sign anywhere of plant or tree, which might\nindicate the presence of moisture. In all that broad landscape there\nwas no gleam of hope. North, and east, and west he looked with wild\nquestioning eyes, and then he realised that his wanderings had come to\nan end, and that there, on that barren crag, he was about to die. \u201cWhy\nnot here, as well as in a feather bed, twenty years hence,\u201d he\nmuttered, as he seated himself in the shelter of a boulder.\n\nBefore sitting down, he had deposited upon the ground his useless\nrifle, and also a large bundle tied up in a grey shawl, which he had\ncarried slung over his right shoulder. It appeared to be somewhat too\nheavy for his strength, for in lowering it, it came down on the ground\nwith some little violence. Instantly there broke from the grey parcel a\nlittle moaning cry, and from it there protruded a small, scared face,\nwith very bright brown eyes, and two little speckled, dimpled fists.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve hurt me!\u201d said a childish voice reproachfully.\n\n\u201cHave I though,\u201d the man answered penitently, \u201cI didn\u2019t go for to do\nit.\u201d As he spoke he unwrapped the grey shawl and extricated a pretty\nlittle girl of about five years of age, whose dainty shoes and smart\npink frock with its little linen apron all bespoke a mother\u2019s care. The\nchild was pale and wan, but her healthy arms and legs showed that she\nhad suffered less than her companion.\n\n\u201cHow is it now?\u201d he answered anxiously, for she was still rubbing the\ntowsy golden curls which covered the back of her head.\n\n\u201cKiss it and make it well,\u201d she said, with perfect gravity, showing the\ninjured part up to him. \u201cThat\u2019s what mother used to do. Where\u2019s\nmother?\u201d\n\n\u201cMother\u2019s gone. I guess you\u2019ll see her before long.\u201d\n\n\u201cGone, eh!\u201d said the little girl. \u201cFunny, she didn\u2019t say good-bye; she\n\u2018most always did if she was just goin\u2019 over to Auntie\u2019s for tea, and\nnow she\u2019s been away three days. Say, it\u2019s awful dry, ain\u2019t it? Ain\u2019t\nthere no water, nor nothing to eat?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, there ain\u2019t nothing, dearie. You\u2019ll just need to be patient\nawhile, and then you\u2019ll be all right. Put your head up agin me like\nthat, and then you\u2019ll feel bullier. It ain\u2019t easy to talk when your\nlips is like leather, but I guess I\u2019d best let you know how the cards\nlie. What\u2019s that you\u2019ve got?\u201d\n\n\u201cPretty things! fine things!\u201d cried the little girl enthusiastically,\nholding up two glittering fragments of mica. \u201cWhen we goes back to home\nI\u2019ll give them to brother Bob.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see prettier things than them soon,\u201d said the man confidently.\n\u201cYou just wait a bit. I was going to tell you though\u2014you remember when\nwe left the river?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we reckoned we\u2019d strike another river soon, d\u2019ye see. But there\nwas somethin\u2019 wrong; compasses, or map, or somethin\u2019, and it didn\u2019t\nturn up. Water ran out. Just except a little drop for the likes of you\nand\u2014and\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you couldn\u2019t wash yourself,\u201d interrupted his companion gravely,\nstaring up at his grimy visage.\n\n\u201cNo, nor drink. And Mr. Bender, he was the fust to go, and then Indian\nPete, and then Mrs. McGregor, and then Johnny Hones, and then, dearie,\nyour mother.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen mother\u2019s a deader too,\u201d cried the little girl dropping her face\nin her pinafore and sobbing bitterly.\n\n\u201cYes, they all went except you and me. Then I thought there was some\nchance of water in this direction, so I heaved you over my shoulder and\nwe tramped it together. It don\u2019t seem as though we\u2019ve improved matters.\nThere\u2019s an almighty small chance for us now!\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you mean that we are going to die too?\u201d asked the child, checking\nher sobs, and raising her tear-stained face.\n\n\u201cI guess that\u2019s about the size of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say so before?\u201d she said, laughing gleefully. \u201cYou gave\nme such a fright. Why, of course, now as long as we die we\u2019ll be with\nmother again.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, you will, dearie.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you too. I\u2019ll tell her how awful good you\u2019ve been. I\u2019ll bet she\nmeets us at the door of Heaven with a big pitcher of water, and a lot\nof buckwheat cakes, hot, and toasted on both sides, like Bob and me was\nfond of. How long will it be first?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014not very long.\u201d The man\u2019s eyes were fixed upon the\nnorthern horizon. In the blue vault of the heaven there had appeared\nthree little specks which increased in size every moment, so rapidly\ndid they approach. They speedily resolved themselves into three large\nbrown birds, which circled over the heads of the two wanderers, and\nthen settled upon some rocks which overlooked them. They were buzzards,\nthe vultures of the west, whose coming is the forerunner of death.\n\n\u201cCocks and hens,\u201d cried the little girl gleefully, pointing at their\nill-omened forms, and clapping her hands to make them rise. \u201cSay, did\nGod make this country?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn course He did,\u201d said her companion, rather startled by this\nunexpected question.\n\n\u201cHe made the country down in Illinois, and He made the Missouri,\u201d the\nlittle girl continued. \u201cI guess somebody else made the country in these\nparts. It\u2019s not nearly so well done. They forgot the water and the\ntrees.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat would ye think of offering up prayer?\u201d the man asked diffidently.\n\n\u201cIt ain\u2019t night yet,\u201d she answered.\n\n\u201cIt don\u2019t matter. It ain\u2019t quite regular, but He won\u2019t mind that, you\nbet. You say over them ones that you used to say every night in the\nwaggon when we was on the Plains.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you say some yourself?\u201d the child asked, with wondering\neyes.\n\n\u201cI disremember them,\u201d he answered. \u201cI hain\u2019t said none since I was half\nthe height o\u2019 that gun. I guess it\u2019s never too late. You say them out,\nand I\u2019ll stand by and come in on the choruses.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you\u2019ll need to kneel down, and me too,\u201d she said, laying the\nshawl out for that purpose. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to put your hands up like this.\nIt makes you feel kind o\u2019 good.\u201d\n\nIt was a strange sight had there been anything but the buzzards to see\nit. Side by side on the narrow shawl knelt the two wanderers, the\nlittle prattling child and the reckless, hardened adventurer. Her\nchubby face, and his haggard, angular visage were both turned up to the\ncloudless heaven in heartfelt entreaty to that dread being with whom\nthey were face to face, while the two voices\u2014the one thin and clear,\nthe other deep and harsh\u2014united in the entreaty for mercy and\nforgiveness. The prayer finished, they resumed their seat in the shadow\nof the boulder until the child fell asleep, nestling upon the broad\nbreast of her protector. He watched over her slumber for some time, but\nNature proved to be too strong for him. For three days and three nights\nhe had allowed himself neither rest nor repose. Slowly the eyelids\ndrooped over the tired eyes, and the head sunk lower and lower upon the\nbreast, until the man\u2019s grizzled beard was mixed with the gold tresses\nof his companion, and both slept the same deep and dreamless slumber.\n\nHad the wanderer remained awake for another half hour a strange sight\nwould have met his eyes. Far away on the extreme verge of the alkali\nplain there rose up a little spray of dust, very slight at first, and\nhardly to be distinguished from the mists of the distance, but\ngradually growing higher and broader until it formed a solid,\nwell-defined cloud. This cloud continued to increase in size until it\nbecame evident that it could only be raised by a great multitude of\nmoving creatures. In more fertile spots the observer would have come to\nthe conclusion that one of those great herds of bisons which graze upon\nthe prairie land was approaching him. This was obviously impossible in\nthese arid wilds. As the whirl of dust drew nearer to the solitary\nbluff upon which the two castaways were reposing, the canvas-covered\ntilts of waggons and the figures of armed horsemen began to show up\nthrough the haze, and the apparition revealed itself as being a great\ncaravan upon its journey for the West. But what a caravan! When the\nhead of it had reached the base of the mountains, the rear was not yet\nvisible on the horizon. Right across the enormous plain stretched the\nstraggling array, waggons and carts, men on horseback, and men on foot.\nInnumerable women who staggered along under burdens, and children who\ntoddled beside the waggons or peeped out from under the white\ncoverings. This was evidently no ordinary party of immigrants, but\nrather some nomad people who had been compelled from stress of\ncircumstances to seek themselves a new country. There rose through the\nclear air a confused clattering and rumbling from this great mass of\nhumanity, with the creaking of wheels and the neighing of horses. Loud\nas it was, it was not sufficient to rouse the two tired wayfarers above\nthem.\n\nAt the head of the column there rode a score or more of grave ironfaced\nmen, clad in sombre homespun garments and armed with rifles. On\nreaching the base of the bluff they halted, and held a short council\namong themselves.\n\n\u201cThe wells are to the right, my brothers,\u201d said one, a hard-lipped,\nclean-shaven man with grizzly hair.\n\n\u201cTo the right of the Sierra Blanco\u2014so we shall reach the Rio Grande,\u201d\nsaid another.\n\n\u201cFear not for water,\u201d cried a third. \u201cHe who could draw it from the\nrocks will not now abandon His own chosen people.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmen! Amen!\u201d responded the whole party.\n\nThey were about to resume their journey when one of the youngest and\nkeenest-eyed uttered an exclamation and pointed up at the rugged crag\nabove them. From its summit there fluttered a little wisp of pink,\nshowing up hard and bright against the grey rocks behind. At the sight\nthere was a general reining up of horses and unslinging of guns, while\nfresh horsemen came galloping up to reinforce the vanguard. The word\n\u2018Redskins\u2019 was on every lip.\n\n\u201cThere can\u2019t be any number of Injuns here,\u201d said the elderly man who\nappeared to be in command. \u201cWe have passed the Pawnees, and there are\nno other tribes until we cross the great mountains.\u201d\n\n\u201cShall I go forward and see, Brother Stangerson,\u201d asked one of the\nband.\n\n\u201cAnd I,\u201d \u201cand I,\u201d cried a dozen voices.\n\n\u201cLeave your horses below and we will await you here,\u201d the Elder\nanswered. In a moment the young fellows had dismounted, fastened their\nhorses, and were ascending the precipitous slope which led up to the\nobject which had excited their curiosity. They advanced rapidly and\nnoiselessly, with the confidence and dexterity of practised scouts. The\nwatchers from the plain below could see them flit from rock to rock\nuntil their figures stood out against the skyline. The young man who\nhad first given the alarm was leading them. Suddenly his followers saw\nhim throw up his hands, as though overcome with astonishment, and on\njoining him they were affected in the same way by the sight which met\ntheir eyes.\n\nOn the little plateau which crowned the barren hill there stood a\nsingle giant boulder, and against this boulder there lay a tall man,\nlong-bearded and hard-featured, but of an excessive thinness. His\nplacid face and regular breathing showed that he was fast asleep.\nBeside him lay a little child, with her round white arms encircling his\nbrown sinewy neck, and her golden haired head resting upon the breast\nof his velveteen tunic. Her rosy lips were parted, showing the regular\nline of snow-white teeth within, and a playful smile played over her\ninfantile features. Her plump little white legs terminating in white\nsocks and neat shoes with shining buckles, offered a strange contrast\nto the long shrivelled members of her companion. On the ledge of rock\nabove this strange couple there stood three solemn buzzards, who, at\nthe sight of the new comers uttered raucous screams of disappointment\nand flapped sullenly away.\n\nThe cries of the foul birds awoke the two sleepers who stared about\nthem in bewilderment. The man staggered to his feet and looked down\nupon the plain which had been so desolate when sleep had overtaken him,\nand which was now traversed by this enormous body of men and of beasts.\nHis face assumed an expression of incredulity as he gazed, and he\npassed his boney hand over his eyes. \u201cThis is what they call delirium,\nI guess,\u201d he muttered. The child stood beside him, holding on to the\nskirt of his coat, and said nothing but looked all round her with the\nwondering questioning gaze of childhood.\n\nThe rescuing party were speedily able to convince the two castaways\nthat their appearance was no delusion. One of them seized the little\ngirl, and hoisted her upon his shoulder, while two others supported her\ngaunt companion, and assisted him towards the waggons.\n\n\u201cMy name is John Ferrier,\u201d the wanderer explained; \u201cme and that little\nun are all that\u2019s left o\u2019 twenty-one people. The rest is all dead o\u2019\nthirst and hunger away down in the south.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs she your child?\u201d asked someone.\n\n\u201cI guess she is now,\u201d the other cried, defiantly; \u201cshe\u2019s mine \u2018cause I\nsaved her. No man will take her from me. She\u2019s Lucy Ferrier from this\nday on. Who are you, though?\u201d he continued, glancing with curiosity at\nhis stalwart, sunburned rescuers; \u201cthere seems to be a powerful lot of\nye.\u201d\n\n\u201cNigh upon ten thousand,\u201d said one of the young men; \u201cwe are the\npersecuted children of God\u2014the chosen of the Angel Merona.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never heard tell on him,\u201d said the wanderer. \u201cHe appears to have\nchosen a fair crowd of ye.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not jest at that which is sacred,\u201d said the other sternly. \u201cWe are\nof those who believe in those sacred writings, drawn in Egyptian\nletters on plates of beaten gold, which were handed unto the holy\nJoseph Smith at Palmyra. We have come from Nauvoo, in the State of\nIllinois, where we had founded our temple. We have come to seek a\nrefuge from the violent man and from the godless, even though it be the\nheart of the desert.\u201d\n\nThe name of Nauvoo evidently recalled recollections to John Ferrier. \u201cI\nsee,\u201d he said, \u201cyou are the Mormons.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are the Mormons,\u201d answered his companions with one voice.\n\n\u201cAnd where are you going?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do not know. The hand of God is leading us under the person of our\nProphet. You must come before him. He shall say what is to be done with\nyou.\u201d\n\nThey had reached the base of the hill by this time, and were surrounded\nby crowds of the pilgrims\u2014pale-faced meek-looking women, strong\nlaughing children, and anxious earnest-eyed men. Many were the cries of\nastonishment and of commiseration which arose from them when they\nperceived the youth of one of the strangers and the destitution of the\nother. Their escort did not halt, however, but pushed on, followed by a\ngreat crowd of Mormons, until they reached a waggon, which was\nconspicuous for its great size and for the gaudiness and smartness of\nits appearance. Six horses were yoked to it, whereas the others were\nfurnished with two, or, at most, four a-piece. Beside the driver there\nsat a man who could not have been more than thirty years of age, but\nwhose massive head and resolute expression marked him as a leader. He\nwas reading a brown-backed volume, but as the crowd approached he laid\nit aside, and listened attentively to an account of the episode. Then\nhe turned to the two castaways.\n\n\u201cIf we take you with us,\u201d he said, in solemn words, \u201cit can only be as\nbelievers in our own creed. We shall have no wolves in our fold. Better\nfar that your bones should bleach in this wilderness than that you\nshould prove to be that little speck of decay which in time corrupts\nthe whole fruit. Will you come with us on these terms?\u201d\n\n\u201cGuess I\u2019ll come with you on any terms,\u201d said Ferrier, with such\nemphasis that the grave Elders could not restrain a smile. The leader\nalone retained his stern, impressive expression.\n\n\u201cTake him, Brother Stangerson,\u201d he said, \u201cgive him food and drink, and\nthe child likewise. Let it be your task also to teach him our holy\ncreed. We have delayed long enough. Forward! On, on to Zion!\u201d\n\n\u201cOn, on to Zion!\u201d cried the crowd of Mormons, and the words rippled\ndown the long caravan, passing from mouth to mouth until they died away\nin a dull murmur in the far distance. With a cracking of whips and a\ncreaking of wheels the great waggons got into motion, and soon the\nwhole caravan was winding along once more. The Elder to whose care the\ntwo waifs had been committed, led them to his waggon, where a meal was\nalready awaiting them.\n\n\u201cYou shall remain here,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a few days you will have\nrecovered from your fatigues. In the meantime, remember that now and\nfor ever you are of our religion. Brigham Young has said it, and he has\nspoken with the voice of Joseph Smith, which is the voice of God.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\nTHE FLOWER OF UTAH.\n\n\nThis is not the place to commemorate the trials and privations endured\nby the immigrant Mormons before they came to their final haven. From\nthe shores of the Mississippi to the western slopes of the Rocky\nMountains they had struggled on with a constancy almost unparalleled in\nhistory. The savage man, and the savage beast, hunger, thirst, fatigue,\nand disease\u2014every impediment which Nature could place in the way, had\nall been overcome with Anglo-Saxon tenacity. Yet the long journey and\nthe accumulated terrors had shaken the hearts of the stoutest among\nthem. There was not one who did not sink upon his knees in heartfelt\nprayer when they saw the broad valley of Utah bathed in the sunlight\nbeneath them, and learned from the lips of their leader that this was\nthe promised land, and that these virgin acres were to be theirs for\nevermore.\n\nYoung speedily proved himself to be a skilful administrator as well as\na resolute chief. Maps were drawn and charts prepared, in which the\nfuture city was sketched out. All around farms were apportioned and\nallotted in proportion to the standing of each individual. The\ntradesman was put to his trade and the artisan to his calling. In the\ntown streets and squares sprang up, as if by magic. In the country\nthere was draining and hedging, planting and clearing, until the next\nsummer saw the whole country golden with the wheat crop. Everything\nprospered in the strange settlement. Above all, the great temple which\nthey had erected in the centre of the city grew ever taller and larger.\nFrom the first blush of dawn until the closing of the twilight, the\nclatter of the hammer and the rasp of the saw was never absent from the\nmonument which the immigrants erected to Him who had led them safe\nthrough many dangers.\n\nThe two castaways, John Ferrier and the little girl who had shared his\nfortunes and had been adopted as his daughter, accompanied the Mormons\nto the end of their great pilgrimage. Little Lucy Ferrier was borne\nalong pleasantly enough in Elder Stangerson\u2019s waggon, a retreat which\nshe shared with the Mormon\u2019s three wives and with his son, a headstrong\nforward boy of twelve. Having rallied, with the elasticity of\nchildhood, from the shock caused by her mother\u2019s death, she soon became\na pet with the women, and reconciled herself to this new life in her\nmoving canvas-covered home. In the meantime Ferrier having recovered\nfrom his privations, distinguished himself as a useful guide and an\nindefatigable hunter. So rapidly did he gain the esteem of his new\ncompanions, that when they reached the end of their wanderings, it was\nunanimously agreed that he should be provided with as large and as\nfertile a tract of land as any of the settlers, with the exception of\nYoung himself, and of Stangerson, Kemball, Johnston, and Drebber, who\nwere the four principal Elders.\n\nOn the farm thus acquired John Ferrier built himself a substantial\nlog-house, which received so many additions in succeeding years that it\ngrew into a roomy villa. He was a man of a practical turn of mind, keen\nin his dealings and skilful with his hands. His iron constitution\nenabled him to work morning and evening at improving and tilling his\nlands. Hence it came about that his farm and all that belonged to him\nprospered exceedingly. In three years he was better off than his\nneighbours, in six he was well-to-do, in nine he was rich, and in\ntwelve there were not half a dozen men in the whole of Salt Lake City\nwho could compare with him. From the great inland sea to the distant\nWahsatch Mountains there was no name better known than that of John\nFerrier.\n\nThere was one way and only one in which he offended the\nsusceptibilities of his co-religionists. No argument or persuasion\ncould ever induce him to set up a female establishment after the manner\nof his companions. He never gave reasons for this persistent refusal,\nbut contented himself by resolutely and inflexibly adhering to his\ndetermination. There were some who accused him of lukewarmness in his\nadopted religion, and others who put it down to greed of wealth and\nreluctance to incur expense. Others, again, spoke of some early love\naffair, and of a fair-haired girl who had pined away on the shores of\nthe Atlantic. Whatever the reason, Ferrier remained strictly celibate.\nIn every other respect he conformed to the religion of the young\nsettlement, and gained the name of being an orthodox and\nstraight-walking man.\n\nLucy Ferrier grew up within the log-house, and assisted her adopted\nfather in all his undertakings. The keen air of the mountains and the\nbalsamic odour of the pine trees took the place of nurse and mother to\nthe young girl. As year succeeded to year she grew taller and stronger,\nher cheek more rudy, and her step more elastic. Many a wayfarer upon\nthe high road which ran by Ferrier\u2019s farm felt long-forgotten thoughts\nrevive in their mind as they watched her lithe girlish figure tripping\nthrough the wheatfields, or met her mounted upon her father\u2019s mustang,\nand managing it with all the ease and grace of a true child of the\nWest. So the bud blossomed into a flower, and the year which saw her\nfather the richest of the farmers left her as fair a specimen of\nAmerican girlhood as could be found in the whole Pacific slope.\n\nIt was not the father, however, who first discovered that the child had\ndeveloped into the woman. It seldom is in such cases. That mysterious\nchange is too subtle and too gradual to be measured by dates. Least of\nall does the maiden herself know it until the tone of a voice or the\ntouch of a hand sets her heart thrilling within her, and she learns,\nwith a mixture of pride and of fear, that a new and a larger nature has\nawoken within her. There are few who cannot recall that day and\nremember the one little incident which heralded the dawn of a new life.\nIn the case of Lucy Ferrier the occasion was serious enough in itself,\napart from its future influence on her destiny and that of many\nbesides.\n\nIt was a warm June morning, and the Latter Day Saints were as busy as\nthe bees whose hive they have chosen for their emblem. In the fields\nand in the streets rose the same hum of human industry. Down the dusty\nhigh roads defiled long streams of heavily-laden mules, all heading to\nthe west, for the gold fever had broken out in California, and the\nOverland Route lay through the City of the Elect. There, too, were\ndroves of sheep and bullocks coming in from the outlying pasture lands,\nand trains of tired immigrants, men and horses equally weary of their\ninterminable journey. Through all this motley assemblage, threading her\nway with the skill of an accomplished rider, there galloped Lucy\nFerrier, her fair face flushed with the exercise and her long chestnut\nhair floating out behind her. She had a commission from her father in\nthe City, and was dashing in as she had done many a time before, with\nall the fearlessness of youth, thinking only of her task and how it was\nto be performed. The travel-stained adventurers gazed after her in\nastonishment, and even the unemotional Indians, journeying in with\ntheir pelties, relaxed their accustomed stoicism as they marvelled at\nthe beauty of the pale-faced maiden.\n\nShe had reached the outskirts of the city when she found the road\nblocked by a great drove of cattle, driven by a half-dozen wild-looking\nherdsmen from the plains. In her impatience she endeavoured to pass\nthis obstacle by pushing her horse into what appeared to be a gap.\nScarcely had she got fairly into it, however, before the beasts closed\nin behind her, and she found herself completely imbedded in the moving\nstream of fierce-eyed, long-horned bullocks. Accustomed as she was to\ndeal with cattle, she was not alarmed at her situation, but took\nadvantage of every opportunity to urge her horse on in the hopes of\npushing her way through the cavalcade. Unfortunately the horns of one\nof the creatures, either by accident or design, came in violent contact\nwith the flank of the mustang, and excited it to madness. In an instant\nit reared up upon its hind legs with a snort of rage, and pranced and\ntossed in a way that would have unseated any but a most skilful rider.\nThe situation was full of peril. Every plunge of the excited horse\nbrought it against the horns again, and goaded it to fresh madness. It\nwas all that the girl could do to keep herself in the saddle, yet a\nslip would mean a terrible death under the hoofs of the unwieldy and\nterrified animals. Unaccustomed to sudden emergencies, her head began\nto swim, and her grip upon the bridle to relax. Choked by the rising\ncloud of dust and by the steam from the struggling creatures, she might\nhave abandoned her efforts in despair, but for a kindly voice at her\nelbow which assured her of assistance. At the same moment a sinewy\nbrown hand caught the frightened horse by the curb, and forcing a way\nthrough the drove, soon brought her to the outskirts.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not hurt, I hope, miss,\u201d said her preserver, respectfully.\n\nShe looked up at his dark, fierce face, and laughed saucily. \u201cI\u2019m awful\nfrightened,\u201d she said, naively; \u201cwhoever would have thought that Poncho\nwould have been so scared by a lot of cows?\u201d\n\n\u201cThank God you kept your seat,\u201d the other said earnestly. He was a\ntall, savage-looking young fellow, mounted on a powerful roan horse,\nand clad in the rough dress of a hunter, with a long rifle slung over\nhis shoulders. \u201cI guess you are the daughter of John Ferrier,\u201d he\nremarked, \u201cI saw you ride down from his house. When you see him, ask\nhim if he remembers the Jefferson Hopes of St. Louis. If he\u2019s the same\nFerrier, my father and he were pretty thick.\u201d\n\n\u201cHadn\u2019t you better come and ask yourself?\u201d she asked, demurely.\n\nThe young fellow seemed pleased at the suggestion, and his dark eyes\nsparkled with pleasure. \u201cI\u2019ll do so,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019ve been in the\nmountains for two months, and are not over and above in visiting\ncondition. He must take us as he finds us.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has a good deal to thank you for, and so have I,\u201d she answered,\n\u201che\u2019s awful fond of me. If those cows had jumped on me he\u2019d have never\ngot over it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNeither would I,\u201d said her companion.\n\n\u201cYou! Well, I don\u2019t see that it would make much matter to you, anyhow.\nYou ain\u2019t even a friend of ours.\u201d\n\nThe young hunter\u2019s dark face grew so gloomy over this remark that Lucy\nFerrier laughed aloud.\n\n\u201cThere, I didn\u2019t mean that,\u201d she said; \u201cof course, you are a friend\nnow. You must come and see us. Now I must push along, or father won\u2019t\ntrust me with his business any more. Good-bye!\u201d\n\n\u201cGood-bye,\u201d he answered, raising his broad sombrero, and bending over\nher little hand. She wheeled her mustang round, gave it a cut with her\nriding-whip, and darted away down the broad road in a rolling cloud of\ndust.\n\nYoung Jefferson Hope rode on with his companions, gloomy and taciturn.\nHe and they had been among the Nevada Mountains prospecting for silver,\nand were returning to Salt Lake City in the hope of raising capital\nenough to work some lodes which they had discovered. He had been as\nkeen as any of them upon the business until this sudden incident had\ndrawn his thoughts into another channel. The sight of the fair young\ngirl, as frank and wholesome as the Sierra breezes, had stirred his\nvolcanic, untamed heart to its very depths. When she had vanished from\nhis sight, he realized that a crisis had come in his life, and that\nneither silver speculations nor any other questions could ever be of\nsuch importance to him as this new and all-absorbing one. The love\nwhich had sprung up in his heart was not the sudden, changeable fancy\nof a boy, but rather the wild, fierce passion of a man of strong will\nand imperious temper. He had been accustomed to succeed in all that he\nundertook. He swore in his heart that he would not fail in this if\nhuman effort and human perseverance could render him successful.\n\nHe called on John Ferrier that night, and many times again, until his\nface was a familiar one at the farm-house. John, cooped up in the\nvalley, and absorbed in his work, had had little chance of learning the\nnews of the outside world during the last twelve years. All this\nJefferson Hope was able to tell him, and in a style which interested\nLucy as well as her father. He had been a pioneer in California, and\ncould narrate many a strange tale of fortunes made and fortunes lost in\nthose wild, halcyon days. He had been a scout too, and a trapper, a\nsilver explorer, and a ranchman. Wherever stirring adventures were to\nbe had, Jefferson Hope had been there in search of them. He soon became\na favourite with the old farmer, who spoke eloquently of his virtues.\nOn such occasions, Lucy was silent, but her blushing cheek and her\nbright, happy eyes, showed only too clearly that her young heart was no\nlonger her own. Her honest father may not have observed these symptoms,\nbut they were assuredly not thrown away upon the man who had won her\naffections.\n\nIt was a summer evening when he came galloping down the road and pulled\nup at the gate. She was at the doorway, and came down to meet him. He\nthrew the bridle over the fence and strode up the pathway.\n\n\u201cI am off, Lucy,\u201d he said, taking her two hands in his, and gazing\ntenderly down into her face; \u201cI won\u2019t ask you to come with me now, but\nwill you be ready to come when I am here again?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd when will that be?\u201d she asked, blushing and laughing.\n\n\u201cA couple of months at the outside. I will come and claim you then, my\ndarling. There\u2019s no one who can stand between us.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how about father?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cHe has given his consent, provided we get these mines working all\nright. I have no fear on that head.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, well; of course, if you and father have arranged it all, there\u2019s\nno more to be said,\u201d she whispered, with her cheek against his broad\nbreast.\n\n\u201cThank God!\u201d he said, hoarsely, stooping and kissing her. \u201cIt is\nsettled, then. The longer I stay, the harder it will be to go. They are\nwaiting for me at the ca\u00f1on. Good-bye, my own darling\u2014good-bye. In two\nmonths you shall see me.\u201d\n\nHe tore himself from her as he spoke, and, flinging himself upon his\nhorse, galloped furiously away, never even looking round, as though\nafraid that his resolution might fail him if he took one glance at what\nhe was leaving. She stood at the gate, gazing after him until he\nvanished from her sight. Then she walked back into the house, the\nhappiest girl in all Utah.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\nJOHN FERRIER TALKS WITH THE PROPHET.\n\n\nThree weeks had passed since Jefferson Hope and his comrades had\ndeparted from Salt Lake City. John Ferrier\u2019s heart was sore within him\nwhen he thought of the young man\u2019s return, and of the impending loss of\nhis adopted child. Yet her bright and happy face reconciled him to the\narrangement more than any argument could have done. He had always\ndetermined, deep down in his resolute heart, that nothing would ever\ninduce him to allow his daughter to wed a Mormon. Such a marriage he\nregarded as no marriage at all, but as a shame and a disgrace. Whatever\nhe might think of the Mormon doctrines, upon that one point he was\ninflexible. He had to seal his mouth on the subject, however, for to\nexpress an unorthodox opinion was a dangerous matter in those days in\nthe Land of the Saints.\n\nYes, a dangerous matter\u2014so dangerous that even the most saintly dared\nonly whisper their religious opinions with bated breath, lest something\nwhich fell from their lips might be misconstrued, and bring down a\nswift retribution upon them. The victims of persecution had now turned\npersecutors on their own account, and persecutors of the most terrible\ndescription. Not the Inquisition of Seville, nor the German\nVehmgericht, nor the Secret Societies of Italy, were ever able to put\na more formidable machinery in motion than that which cast a cloud over\nthe State of Utah.\n\nIts invisibility, and the mystery which was attached to it, made this\norganization doubly terrible. It appeared to be omniscient and\nomnipotent, and yet was neither seen nor heard. The man who held out\nagainst the Church vanished away, and none knew whither he had gone or\nwhat had befallen him. His wife and his children awaited him at home,\nbut no father ever returned to tell them how he had fared at the hands\nof his secret judges. A rash word or a hasty act was followed by\nannihilation, and yet none knew what the nature might be of this\nterrible power which was suspended over them. No wonder that men went\nabout in fear and trembling, and that even in the heart of the\nwilderness they dared not whisper the doubts which oppressed them.\n\nAt first this vague and terrible power was exercised only upon the\nrecalcitrants who, having embraced the Mormon faith, wished afterwards\nto pervert or to abandon it. Soon, however, it took a wider range. The\nsupply of adult women was running short, and polygamy without a female\npopulation on which to draw was a barren doctrine indeed. Strange\nrumours began to be bandied about\u2014rumours of murdered immigrants and\nrifled camps in regions where Indians had never been seen. Fresh women\nappeared in the harems of the Elders\u2014women who pined and wept, and bore\nupon their faces the traces of an unextinguishable horror. Belated\nwanderers upon the mountains spoke of gangs of armed men, masked,\nstealthy, and noiseless, who flitted by them in the darkness. These\ntales and rumours took substance and shape, and were corroborated and\nre-corroborated, until they resolved themselves into a definite name.\nTo this day, in the lonely ranches of the West, the name of the Danite\nBand, or the Avenging Angels, is a sinister and an ill-omened one.\n\nFuller knowledge of the organization which produced such terrible\nresults served to increase rather than to lessen the horror which it\ninspired in the minds of men. None knew who belonged to this ruthless\nsociety. The names of the participators in the deeds of blood and\nviolence done under the name of religion were kept profoundly secret.\nThe very friend to whom you communicated your misgivings as to the\nProphet and his mission, might be one of those who would come forth at\nnight with fire and sword to exact a terrible reparation. Hence every\nman feared his neighbour, and none spoke of the things which were\nnearest his heart.\n\nOne fine morning, John Ferrier was about to set out to his wheatfields,\nwhen he heard the click of the latch, and, looking through the window,\nsaw a stout, sandy-haired, middle-aged man coming up the pathway. His\nheart leapt to his mouth, for this was none other than the great\nBrigham Young himself. Full of trepidation\u2014for he knew that such a\nvisit boded him little good\u2014Ferrier ran to the door to greet the Mormon\nchief. The latter, however, received his salutations coldly, and\nfollowed him with a stern face into the sitting-room.\n\n\u201cBrother Ferrier,\u201d he said, taking a seat, and eyeing the farmer keenly\nfrom under his light-coloured eyelashes, \u201cthe true believers have been\ngood friends to you. We picked you up when you were starving in the\ndesert, we shared our food with you, led you safe to the Chosen Valley,\ngave you a goodly share of land, and allowed you to wax rich under our\nprotection. Is not this so?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is so,\u201d answered John Ferrier.\n\n\u201cIn return for all this we asked but one condition: that was, that you\nshould embrace the true faith, and conform in every way to its usages.\nThis you promised to do, and this, if common report says truly, you\nhave neglected.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how have I neglected it?\u201d asked Ferrier, throwing out his hands in\nexpostulation. \u201cHave I not given to the common fund? Have I not\nattended at the Temple? Have I not\u2014\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere are your wives?\u201d asked Young, looking round him. \u201cCall them in,\nthat I may greet them.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is true that I have not married,\u201d Ferrier answered. \u201cBut women were\nfew, and there were many who had better claims than I. I was not a\nlonely man: I had my daughter to attend to my wants.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is of that daughter that I would speak to you,\u201d said the leader of\nthe Mormons. \u201cShe has grown to be the flower of Utah, and has found\nfavour in the eyes of many who are high in the land.\u201d\n\nJohn Ferrier groaned internally.\n\n\u201cThere are stories of her which I would fain disbelieve\u2014stories that\nshe is sealed to some Gentile. This must be the gossip of idle tongues.\nWhat is the thirteenth rule in the code of the sainted Joseph Smith?\n\u2018Let every maiden of the true faith marry one of the elect; for if she\nwed a Gentile, she commits a grievous sin.\u2019 This being so, it is\nimpossible that you, who profess the holy creed, should suffer your\ndaughter to violate it.\u201d\n\nJohn Ferrier made no answer, but he played nervously with his\nriding-whip.\n\n\u201cUpon this one point your whole faith shall be tested\u2014so it has been\ndecided in the Sacred Council of Four. The girl is young, and we would\nnot have her wed grey hairs, neither would we deprive her of all\nchoice. We Elders have many heifers,[1] but our children must also be\nprovided. Stangerson has a son, and Drebber has a son, and either of\nthem would gladly welcome your daughter to their house. Let her choose\nbetween them. They are young and rich, and of the true faith. What say\nyou to that?\u201d\n\n[1] Heber C. Kemball, in one of his sermons, alludes to his hundred\nwives under this endearing epithet.\n\nFerrier remained silent for some little time with his brows knitted.\n\n\u201cYou will give us time,\u201d he said at last. \u201cMy daughter is very\nyoung\u2014she is scarce of an age to marry.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe shall have a month to choose,\u201d said Young, rising from his seat.\n\u201cAt the end of that time she shall give her answer.\u201d\n\nHe was passing through the door, when he turned, with flushed face and\nflashing eyes. \u201cIt were better for you, John Ferrier,\u201d he thundered,\n\u201cthat you and she were now lying blanched skeletons upon the Sierra\nBlanco, than that you should put your weak wills against the orders of\nthe Holy Four!\u201d\n\nWith a threatening gesture of his hand, he turned from the door, and\nFerrier heard his heavy step scrunching along the shingly path.\n\nHe was still sitting with his elbows upon his knees, considering how he\nshould broach the matter to his daughter when a soft hand was laid upon\nhis, and looking up, he saw her standing beside him. One glance at her\npale, frightened face showed him that she had heard what had passed.\n\n\u201cI could not help it,\u201d she said, in answer to his look. \u201cHis voice rang\nthrough the house. Oh, father, father, what shall we do?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you scare yourself,\u201d he answered, drawing her to him, and\npassing his broad, rough hand caressingly over her chestnut hair.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll fix it up somehow or another. You don\u2019t find your fancy kind o\u2019\nlessening for this chap, do you?\u201d\n\nA sob and a squeeze of his hand was her only answer.\n\n\u201cNo; of course not. I shouldn\u2019t care to hear you say you did. He\u2019s a\nlikely lad, and he\u2019s a Christian, which is more than these folk here,\nin spite o\u2019 all their praying and preaching. There\u2019s a party starting\nfor Nevada to-morrow, and I\u2019ll manage to send him a message letting him\nknow the hole we are in. If I know anything o\u2019 that young man, he\u2019ll be\nback here with a speed that would whip electro-telegraphs.\u201d\n\nLucy laughed through her tears at her father\u2019s description.\n\n\u201cWhen he comes, he will advise us for the best. But it is for you that\nI am frightened, dear. One hears\u2014one hears such dreadful stories about\nthose who oppose the Prophet: something terrible always happens to\nthem.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we haven\u2019t opposed him yet,\u201d her father answered. \u201cIt will be time\nto look out for squalls when we do. We have a clear month before us; at\nthe end of that, I guess we had best shin out of Utah.\u201d\n\n\u201cLeave Utah!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s about the size of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the farm?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will raise as much as we can in money, and let the rest go. To tell\nthe truth, Lucy, it isn\u2019t the first time I have thought of doing it. I\ndon\u2019t care about knuckling under to any man, as these folk do to their\ndarned prophet. I\u2019m a free-born American, and it\u2019s all new to me. Guess\nI\u2019m too old to learn. If he comes browsing about this farm, he might\nchance to run up against a charge of buckshot travelling in the\nopposite direction.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut they won\u2019t let us leave,\u201d his daughter objected.\n\n\u201cWait till Jefferson comes, and we\u2019ll soon manage that. In the\nmeantime, don\u2019t you fret yourself, my dearie, and don\u2019t get your eyes\nswelled up, else he\u2019ll be walking into me when he sees you. There\u2019s\nnothing to be afeared about, and there\u2019s no danger at all.\u201d\n\nJohn Ferrier uttered these consoling remarks in a very confident tone,\nbut she could not help observing that he paid unusual care to the\nfastening of the doors that night, and that he carefully cleaned and\nloaded the rusty old shotgun which hung upon the wall of his bedroom.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\nA FLIGHT FOR LIFE.\n\n\nOn the morning which followed his interview with the Mormon Prophet,\nJohn Ferrier went in to Salt Lake City, and having found his\nacquaintance, who was bound for the Nevada Mountains, he entrusted him\nwith his message to Jefferson Hope. In it he told the young man of the\nimminent danger which threatened them, and how necessary it was that he\nshould return. Having done thus he felt easier in his mind, and\nreturned home with a lighter heart.\n\nAs he approached his farm, he was surprised to see a horse hitched to\neach of the posts of the gate. Still more surprised was he on entering\nto find two young men in possession of his sitting-room. One, with a\nlong pale face, was leaning back in the rocking-chair, with his feet\ncocked up upon the stove. The other, a bull-necked youth with coarse\nbloated features, was standing in front of the window with his hands in\nhis pocket, whistling a popular hymn. Both of them nodded to Ferrier as\nhe entered, and the one in the rocking-chair commenced the\nconversation.\n\n\u201cMaybe you don\u2019t know us,\u201d he said. \u201cThis here is the son of Elder\nDrebber, and I\u2019m Joseph Stangerson, who travelled with you in the\ndesert when the Lord stretched out His hand and gathered you into the\ntrue fold.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs He will all the nations in His own good time,\u201d said the other in a\nnasal voice; \u201cHe grindeth slowly but exceeding small.\u201d\n\nJohn Ferrier bowed coldly. He had guessed who his visitors were.\n\n\u201cWe have come,\u201d continued Stangerson, \u201cat the advice of our fathers to\nsolicit the hand of your daughter for whichever of us may seem good to\nyou and to her. As I have but four wives and Brother Drebber here has\nseven, it appears to me that my claim is the stronger one.\u201d\n\n\u201cNay, nay, Brother Stangerson,\u201d cried the other; \u201cthe question is not\nhow many wives we have, but how many we can keep. My father has now\ngiven over his mills to me, and I am the richer man.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut my prospects are better,\u201d said the other, warmly. \u201cWhen the Lord\nremoves my father, I shall have his tanning yard and his leather\nfactory. Then I am your elder, and am higher in the Church.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will be for the maiden to decide,\u201d rejoined young Drebber, smirking\nat his own reflection in the glass. \u201cWe will leave it all to her\ndecision.\u201d\n\nDuring this dialogue, John Ferrier had stood fuming in the doorway,\nhardly able to keep his riding-whip from the backs of his two visitors.\n\n\u201cLook here,\u201d he said at last, striding up to them, \u201cwhen my daughter\nsummons you, you can come, but until then I don\u2019t want to see your\nfaces again.\u201d\n\nThe two young Mormons stared at him in amazement. In their eyes this\ncompetition between them for the maiden\u2019s hand was the highest of\nhonours both to her and her father.\n\n\u201cThere are two ways out of the room,\u201d cried Ferrier; \u201cthere is the\ndoor, and there is the window. Which do you care to use?\u201d\n\nHis brown face looked so savage, and his gaunt hands so threatening,\nthat his visitors sprang to their feet and beat a hurried retreat. The\nold farmer followed them to the door.\n\n\u201cLet me know when you have settled which it is to be,\u201d he said,\nsardonically.\n\n\u201cYou shall smart for this!\u201d Stangerson cried, white with rage. \u201cYou\nhave defied the Prophet and the Council of Four. You shall rue it to\nthe end of your days.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe hand of the Lord shall be heavy upon you,\u201d cried young Drebber;\n\u201cHe will arise and smite you!\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll start the smiting,\u201d exclaimed Ferrier furiously, and would\nhave rushed upstairs for his gun had not Lucy seized him by the arm and\nrestrained him. Before he could escape from her, the clatter of horses\u2019\nhoofs told him that they were beyond his reach.\n\n\u201cThe young canting rascals!\u201d he exclaimed, wiping the perspiration from\nhis forehead; \u201cI would sooner see you in your grave, my girl, than the\nwife of either of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so should I, father,\u201d she answered, with spirit; \u201cbut Jefferson\nwill soon be here.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. It will not be long before he comes. The sooner the better, for\nwe do not know what their next move may be.\u201d\n\nIt was, indeed, high time that someone capable of giving advice and\nhelp should come to the aid of the sturdy old farmer and his adopted\ndaughter. In the whole history of the settlement there had never been\nsuch a case of rank disobedience to the authority of the Elders. If\nminor errors were punished so sternly, what would be the fate of this\narch rebel. Ferrier knew that his wealth and position would be of no\navail to him. Others as well known and as rich as himself had been\nspirited away before now, and their goods given over to the Church. He\nwas a brave man, but he trembled at the vague, shadowy terrors which\nhung over him. Any known danger he could face with a firm lip, but this\nsuspense was unnerving. He concealed his fears from his daughter,\nhowever, and affected to make light of the whole matter, though she,\nwith the keen eye of love, saw plainly that he was ill at ease.\n\nHe expected that he would receive some message or remonstrance from\nYoung as to his conduct, and he was not mistaken, though it came in an\nunlooked-for manner. Upon rising next morning he found, to his\nsurprise, a small square of paper pinned on to the coverlet of his bed\njust over his chest. On it was printed, in bold straggling letters:\u2014\n\n\u201cTwenty-nine days are given you for amendment, and then\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\nThe dash was more fear-inspiring than any threat could have been. How\nthis warning came into his room puzzled John Ferrier sorely, for his\nservants slept in an outhouse, and the doors and windows had all been\nsecured. He crumpled the paper up and said nothing to his daughter, but\nthe incident struck a chill into his heart. The twenty-nine days were\nevidently the balance of the month which Young had promised. What\nstrength or courage could avail against an enemy armed with such\nmysterious powers? The hand which fastened that pin might have struck\nhim to the heart, and he could never have known who had slain him.\n\nStill more shaken was he next morning. They had sat down to their\nbreakfast when Lucy with a cry of surprise pointed upwards. In the\ncentre of the ceiling was scrawled, with a burned stick apparently, the\nnumber 28. To his daughter it was unintelligible, and he did not\nenlighten her. That night he sat up with his gun and kept watch and\nward. He saw and he heard nothing, and yet in the morning a great 27\nhad been painted upon the outside of his door.\n\nThus day followed day; and as sure as morning came he found that his\nunseen enemies had kept their register, and had marked up in some\nconspicuous position how many days were still left to him out of the\nmonth of grace. Sometimes the fatal numbers appeared upon the walls,\nsometimes upon the floors, occasionally they were on small placards\nstuck upon the garden gate or the railings. With all his vigilance John\nFerrier could not discover whence these daily warnings proceeded. A\nhorror which was almost superstitious came upon him at the sight of\nthem. He became haggard and restless, and his eyes had the troubled\nlook of some hunted creature. He had but one hope in life now, and that\nwas for the arrival of the young hunter from Nevada.\n\nTwenty had changed to fifteen and fifteen to ten, but there was no news\nof the absentee. One by one the numbers dwindled down, and still there\ncame no sign of him. Whenever a horseman clattered down the road, or a\ndriver shouted at his team, the old farmer hurried to the gate thinking\nthat help had arrived at last. At last, when he saw five give way to\nfour and that again to three, he lost heart, and abandoned all hope of\nescape. Single-handed, and with his limited knowledge of the mountains\nwhich surrounded the settlement, he knew that he was powerless. The\nmore-frequented roads were strictly watched and guarded, and none could\npass along them without an order from the Council. Turn which way he\nwould, there appeared to be no avoiding the blow which hung over him.\nYet the old man never wavered in his resolution to part with life\nitself before he consented to what he regarded as his daughter\u2019s\ndishonour.\n\nHe was sitting alone one evening pondering deeply over his troubles,\nand searching vainly for some way out of them. That morning had shown\nthe figure 2 upon the wall of his house, and the next day would be the\nlast of the allotted time. What was to happen then? All manner of vague\nand terrible fancies filled his imagination. And his daughter\u2014what was\nto become of her after he was gone? Was there no escape from the\ninvisible network which was drawn all round them. He sank his head upon\nthe table and sobbed at the thought of his own impotence.\n\nWhat was that? In the silence he heard a gentle scratching sound\u2014low,\nbut very distinct in the quiet of the night. It came from the door of\nthe house. Ferrier crept into the hall and listened intently. There was\na pause for a few moments, and then the low insidious sound was\nrepeated. Someone was evidently tapping very gently upon one of the\npanels of the door. Was it some midnight assassin who had come to carry\nout the murderous orders of the secret tribunal? Or was it some agent\nwho was marking up that the last day of grace had arrived. John Ferrier\nfelt that instant death would be better than the suspense which shook\nhis nerves and chilled his heart. Springing forward he drew the bolt\nand threw the door open.\n\nOutside all was calm and quiet. The night was fine, and the stars were\ntwinkling brightly overhead. The little front garden lay before the\nfarmer\u2019s eyes bounded by the fence and gate, but neither there nor on\nthe road was any human being to be seen. With a sigh of relief, Ferrier\nlooked to right and to left, until happening to glance straight down at\nhis own feet he saw to his astonishment a man lying flat upon his face\nupon the ground, with arms and legs all asprawl.\n\nSo unnerved was he at the sight that he leaned up against the wall with\nhis hand to his throat to stifle his inclination to call out. His first\nthought was that the prostrate figure was that of some wounded or dying\nman, but as he watched it he saw it writhe along the ground and into\nthe hall with the rapidity and noiselessness of a serpent. Once within\nthe house the man sprang to his feet, closed the door, and revealed to\nthe astonished farmer the fierce face and resolute expression of\nJefferson Hope.\n\n\u201cGood God!\u201d gasped John Ferrier. \u201cHow you scared me! Whatever made you\ncome in like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive me food,\u201d the other said, hoarsely. \u201cI have had no time for bite\nor sup for eight-and-forty hours.\u201d He flung himself upon the cold meat\nand bread which were still lying upon the table from his host\u2019s supper,\nand devoured it voraciously. \u201cDoes Lucy bear up well?\u201d he asked, when\nhe had satisfied his hunger.\n\n\u201cYes. She does not know the danger,\u201d her father answered.\n\n\u201cThat is well. The house is watched on every side. That is why I\ncrawled my way up to it. They may be darned sharp, but they\u2019re not\nquite sharp enough to catch a Washoe hunter.\u201d\n\nJohn Ferrier felt a different man now that he realized that he had a\ndevoted ally. He seized the young man\u2019s leathery hand and wrung it\ncordially. \u201cYou\u2019re a man to be proud of,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are not many\nwho would come to share our danger and our troubles.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve hit it there, pard,\u201d the young hunter answered. \u201cI have a\nrespect for you, but if you were alone in this business I\u2019d think twice\nbefore I put my head into such a hornet\u2019s nest. It\u2019s Lucy that brings\nme here, and before harm comes on her I guess there will be one less o\u2019\nthe Hope family in Utah.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are we to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo-morrow is your last day, and unless you act to-night you are lost.\nI have a mule and two horses waiting in the Eagle Ravine. How much\nmoney have you?\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo thousand dollars in gold, and five in notes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat will do. I have as much more to add to it. We must push for\nCarson City through the mountains. You had best wake Lucy. It is as\nwell that the servants do not sleep in the house.\u201d\n\nWhile Ferrier was absent, preparing his daughter for the approaching\njourney, Jefferson Hope packed all the eatables that he could find into\na small parcel, and filled a stoneware jar with water, for he knew by\nexperience that the mountain wells were few and far between. He had\nhardly completed his arrangements before the farmer returned with his\ndaughter all dressed and ready for a start. The greeting between the\nlovers was warm, but brief, for minutes were precious, and there was\nmuch to be done.\n\n\u201cWe must make our start at once,\u201d said Jefferson Hope, speaking in a\nlow but resolute voice, like one who realizes the greatness of the\nperil, but has steeled his heart to meet it. \u201cThe front and back\nentrances are watched, but with caution we may get away through the\nside window and across the fields. Once on the road we are only two\nmiles from the Ravine where the horses are waiting. By daybreak we\nshould be half-way through the mountains.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if we are stopped,\u201d asked Ferrier.\n\nHope slapped the revolver butt which protruded from the front of his\ntunic. \u201cIf they are too many for us we shall take two or three of them\nwith us,\u201d he said with a sinister smile.\n\nThe lights inside the house had all been extinguished, and from the\ndarkened window Ferrier peered over the fields which had been his own,\nand which he was now about to abandon for ever. He had long nerved\nhimself to the sacrifice, however, and the thought of the honour and\nhappiness of his daughter outweighed any regret at his ruined fortunes.\nAll looked so peaceful and happy, the rustling trees and the broad\nsilent stretch of grain-land, that it was difficult to realize that the\nspirit of murder lurked through it all. Yet the white face and set\nexpression of the young hunter showed that in his approach to the house\nhe had seen enough to satisfy him upon that head.\n\nFerrier carried the bag of gold and notes, Jefferson Hope had the\nscanty provisions and water, while Lucy had a small bundle containing a\nfew of her more valued possessions. Opening the window very slowly and\ncarefully, they waited until a dark cloud had somewhat obscured the\nnight, and then one by one passed through into the little garden. With\nbated breath and crouching figures they stumbled across it, and gained\nthe shelter of the hedge, which they skirted until they came to the gap\nwhich opened into the cornfields. They had just reached this point when\nthe young man seized his two companions and dragged them down into the\nshadow, where they lay silent and trembling.\n\nIt was as well that his prairie training had given Jefferson Hope the\nears of a lynx. He and his friends had hardly crouched down before the\nmelancholy hooting of a mountain owl was heard within a few yards of\nthem, which was immediately answered by another hoot at a small\ndistance. At the same moment a vague shadowy figure emerged from the\ngap for which they had been making, and uttered the plaintive signal\ncry again, on which a second man appeared out of the obscurity.\n\n\u201cTo-morrow at midnight,\u201d said the first who appeared to be in\nauthority. \u201cWhen the Whip-poor-Will calls three times.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is well,\u201d returned the other. \u201cShall I tell Brother Drebber?\u201d\n\n\u201cPass it on to him, and from him to the others. Nine to seven!\u201d\n\n\u201cSeven to five!\u201d repeated the other, and the two figures flitted away\nin different directions. Their concluding words had evidently been some\nform of sign and countersign. The instant that their footsteps had died\naway in the distance, Jefferson Hope sprang to his feet, and helping\nhis companions through the gap, led the way across the fields at the\ntop of his speed, supporting and half-carrying the girl when her\nstrength appeared to fail her.\n\n\u201cHurry on! hurry on!\u201d he gasped from time to time. \u201cWe are through the\nline of sentinels. Everything depends on speed. Hurry on!\u201d\n\nOnce on the high road they made rapid progress. Only once did they meet\nanyone, and then they managed to slip into a field, and so avoid\nrecognition. Before reaching the town the hunter branched away into a\nrugged and narrow footpath which led to the mountains. Two dark jagged\npeaks loomed above them through the darkness, and the defile which led\nbetween them was the Eagle Ca\u00f1on in which the horses were awaiting\nthem. With unerring instinct Jefferson Hope picked his way among the\ngreat boulders and along the bed of a dried-up watercourse, until he\ncame to the retired corner, screened with rocks, where the faithful\nanimals had been picketed. The girl was placed upon the mule, and old\nFerrier upon one of the horses, with his money-bag, while Jefferson\nHope led the other along the precipitous and dangerous path.\n\nIt was a bewildering route for anyone who was not accustomed to face\nNature in her wildest moods. On the one side a great crag towered up a\nthousand feet or more, black, stern, and menacing, with long basaltic\ncolumns upon its rugged surface like the ribs of some petrified\nmonster. On the other hand a wild chaos of boulders and debris made all\nadvance impossible. Between the two ran the irregular track, so narrow\nin places that they had to travel in Indian file, and so rough that\nonly practised riders could have traversed it at all. Yet in spite of\nall dangers and difficulties, the hearts of the fugitives were light\nwithin them, for every step increased the distance between them and the\nterrible despotism from which they were flying.\n\nThey soon had a proof, however, that they were still within the\njurisdiction of the Saints. They had reached the very wildest and most\ndesolate portion of the pass when the girl gave a startled cry, and\npointed upwards. On a rock which overlooked the track, showing out dark\nand plain against the sky, there stood a solitary sentinel. He saw them\nas soon as they perceived him, and his military challenge of \u201cWho goes\nthere?\u201d rang through the silent ravine.\n\n\u201cTravellers for Nevada,\u201d said Jefferson Hope, with his hand upon the\nrifle which hung by his saddle.\n\nThey could see the lonely watcher fingering his gun, and peering down\nat them as if dissatisfied at their reply.\n\n\u201cBy whose permission?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cThe Holy Four,\u201d answered Ferrier. His Mormon experiences had taught\nhim that that was the highest authority to which he could refer.\n\n\u201cNine from seven,\u201d cried the sentinel.\n\n\u201cSeven from five,\u201d returned Jefferson Hope promptly, remembering the\ncountersign which he had heard in the garden.\n\n\u201cPass, and the Lord go with you,\u201d said the voice from above. Beyond his\npost the path broadened out, and the horses were able to break into a\ntrot. Looking back, they could see the solitary watcher leaning upon\nhis gun, and knew that they had passed the outlying post of the chosen\npeople, and that freedom lay before them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\nTHE AVENGING ANGELS.\n\n\nAll night their course lay through intricate defiles and over irregular\nand rock-strewn paths. More than once they lost their way, but Hope\u2019s\nintimate knowledge of the mountains enabled them to regain the track\nonce more. When morning broke, a scene of marvellous though savage\nbeauty lay before them. In every direction the great snow-capped peaks\nhemmed them in, peeping over each other\u2019s shoulders to the far horizon.\nSo steep were the rocky banks on either side of them, that the larch\nand the pine seemed to be suspended over their heads, and to need only\na gust of wind to come hurtling down upon them. Nor was the fear\nentirely an illusion, for the barren valley was thickly strewn with\ntrees and boulders which had fallen in a similar manner. Even as they\npassed, a great rock came thundering down with a hoarse rattle which\nwoke the echoes in the silent gorges, and startled the weary horses\ninto a gallop.\n\nAs the sun rose slowly above the eastern horizon, the caps of the great\nmountains lit up one after the other, like lamps at a festival, until\nthey were all ruddy and glowing. The magnificent spectacle cheered the\nhearts of the three fugitives and gave them fresh energy. At a wild\ntorrent which swept out of a ravine they called a halt and watered\ntheir horses, while they partook of a hasty breakfast. Lucy and her\nfather would fain have rested longer, but Jefferson Hope was\ninexorable. \u201cThey will be upon our track by this time,\u201d he said.\n\u201cEverything depends upon our speed. Once safe in Carson we may rest for\nthe remainder of our lives.\u201d\n\nDuring the whole of that day they struggled on through the defiles, and\nby evening they calculated that they were more than thirty miles from\ntheir enemies. At night-time they chose the base of a beetling crag,\nwhere the rocks offered some protection from the chill wind, and there\nhuddled together for warmth, they enjoyed a few hours\u2019 sleep. Before\ndaybreak, however, they were up and on their way once more. They had\nseen no signs of any pursuers, and Jefferson Hope began to think that\nthey were fairly out of the reach of the terrible organization whose\nenmity they had incurred. He little knew how far that iron grasp could\nreach, or how soon it was to close upon them and crush them.\n\nAbout the middle of the second day of their flight their scanty store\nof provisions began to run out. This gave the hunter little uneasiness,\nhowever, for there was game to be had among the mountains, and he had\nfrequently before had to depend upon his rifle for the needs of life.\nChoosing a sheltered nook, he piled together a few dried branches and\nmade a blazing fire, at which his companions might warm themselves, for\nthey were now nearly five thousand feet above the sea level, and the\nair was bitter and keen. Having tethered the horses, and bade Lucy\nadieu, he threw his gun over his shoulder, and set out in search of\nwhatever chance might throw in his way. Looking back he saw the old man\nand the young girl crouching over the blazing fire, while the three\nanimals stood motionless in the back-ground. Then the intervening rocks\nhid them from his view.\n\nHe walked for a couple of miles through one ravine after another\nwithout success, though from the marks upon the bark of the trees, and\nother indications, he judged that there were numerous bears in the\nvicinity. At last, after two or three hours\u2019 fruitless search, he was\nthinking of turning back in despair, when casting his eyes upwards he\nsaw a sight which sent a thrill of pleasure through his heart. On the\nedge of a jutting pinnacle, three or four hundred feet above him, there\nstood a creature somewhat resembling a sheep in appearance, but armed\nwith a pair of gigantic horns. The big-horn\u2014for so it is called\u2014was\nacting, probably, as a guardian over a flock which were invisible to\nthe hunter; but fortunately it was heading in the opposite direction,\nand had not perceived him. Lying on his face, he rested his rifle upon\na rock, and took a long and steady aim before drawing the trigger. The\nanimal sprang into the air, tottered for a moment upon the edge of the\nprecipice, and then came crashing down into the valley beneath.\n\nThe creature was too unwieldy to lift, so the hunter contented himself\nwith cutting away one haunch and part of the flank. With this trophy\nover his shoulder, he hastened to retrace his steps, for the evening\nwas already drawing in. He had hardly started, however, before he\nrealized the difficulty which faced him. In his eagerness he had\nwandered far past the ravines which were known to him, and it was no\neasy matter to pick out the path which he had taken. The valley in\nwhich he found himself divided and sub-divided into many gorges, which\nwere so like each other that it was impossible to distinguish one from\nthe other. He followed one for a mile or more until he came to a\nmountain torrent which he was sure that he had never seen before.\nConvinced that he had taken the wrong turn, he tried another, but with\nthe same result. Night was coming on rapidly, and it was almost dark\nbefore he at last found himself in a defile which was familiar to him.\nEven then it was no easy matter to keep to the right track, for the\nmoon had not yet risen, and the high cliffs on either side made the\nobscurity more profound. Weighed down with his burden, and weary from\nhis exertions, he stumbled along, keeping up his heart by the\nreflection that every step brought him nearer to Lucy, and that he\ncarried with him enough to ensure them food for the remainder of their\njourney.\n\nHe had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left\nthem. Even in the darkness he could recognize the outline of the cliffs\nwhich bounded it. They must, he reflected, be awaiting him anxiously,\nfor he had been absent nearly five hours. In the gladness of his heart\nhe put his hands to his mouth and made the glen re-echo to a loud\nhalloo as a signal that he was coming. He paused and listened for an\nanswer. None came save his own cry, which clattered up the dreary\nsilent ravines, and was borne back to his ears in countless\nrepetitions. Again he shouted, even louder than before, and again no\nwhisper came back from the friends whom he had left such a short time\nago. A vague, nameless dread came over him, and he hurried onwards\nfrantically, dropping the precious food in his agitation.\n\nWhen he turned the corner, he came full in sight of the spot where the\nfire had been lit. There was still a glowing pile of wood ashes there,\nbut it had evidently not been tended since his departure. The same dead\nsilence still reigned all round. With his fears all changed to\nconvictions, he hurried on. There was no living creature near the\nremains of the fire: animals, man, maiden, all were gone. It was only\ntoo clear that some sudden and terrible disaster had occurred during\nhis absence\u2014a disaster which had embraced them all, and yet had left no\ntraces behind it.\n\nBewildered and stunned by this blow, Jefferson Hope felt his head spin\nround, and had to lean upon his rifle to save himself from falling. He\nwas essentially a man of action, however, and speedily recovered from\nhis temporary impotence. Seizing a half-consumed piece of wood from the\nsmouldering fire, he blew it into a flame, and proceeded with its help\nto examine the little camp. The ground was all stamped down by the feet\nof horses, showing that a large party of mounted men had overtaken the\nfugitives, and the direction of their tracks proved that they had\nafterwards turned back to Salt Lake City. Had they carried back both of\nhis companions with them? Jefferson Hope had almost persuaded himself\nthat they must have done so, when his eye fell upon an object which\nmade every nerve of his body tingle within him. A little way on one\nside of the camp was a low-lying heap of reddish soil, which had\nassuredly not been there before. There was no mistaking it for anything\nbut a newly-dug grave. As the young hunter approached it, he perceived\nthat a stick had been planted on it, with a sheet of paper stuck in the\ncleft fork of it. The inscription upon the paper was brief, but to the\npoint:\n\n\nJOHN FERRIER,\nFORMERLY OF SALT LAKE CITY,\nDied August 4th, 1860.\n\n\nThe sturdy old man, whom he had left so short a time before, was gone,\nthen, and this was all his epitaph. Jefferson Hope looked wildly round\nto see if there was a second grave, but there was no sign of one. Lucy\nhad been carried back by their terrible pursuers to fulfil her original\ndestiny, by becoming one of the harem of the Elder\u2019s son. As the young\nfellow realized the certainty of her fate, and his own powerlessness to\nprevent it, he wished that he, too, was lying with the old farmer in\nhis last silent resting-place.\n\nAgain, however, his active spirit shook off the lethargy which springs\nfrom despair. If there was nothing else left to him, he could at least\ndevote his life to revenge. With indomitable patience and perseverance,\nJefferson Hope possessed also a power of sustained vindictiveness,\nwhich he may have learned from the Indians amongst whom he had lived.\nAs he stood by the desolate fire, he felt that the only one thing which\ncould assuage his grief would be thorough and complete retribution,\nbrought by his own hand upon his enemies. His strong will and untiring\nenergy should, he determined, be devoted to that one end. With a grim,\nwhite face, he retraced his steps to where he had dropped the food, and\nhaving stirred up the smouldering fire, he cooked enough to last him\nfor a few days. This he made up into a bundle, and, tired as he was, he\nset himself to walk back through the mountains upon the track of the\navenging angels.\n\nFor five days he toiled footsore and weary through the defiles which he\nhad already traversed on horseback. At night he flung himself down\namong the rocks, and snatched a few hours of sleep; but before daybreak\nhe was always well on his way. On the sixth day, he reached the Eagle\nCa\u00f1on, from which they had commenced their ill-fated flight. Thence he\ncould look down upon the home of the saints. Worn and exhausted, he\nleaned upon his rifle and shook his gaunt hand fiercely at the silent\nwidespread city beneath him. As he looked at it, he observed that there\nwere flags in some of the principal streets, and other signs of\nfestivity. He was still speculating as to what this might mean when he\nheard the clatter of horse\u2019s hoofs, and saw a mounted man riding\ntowards him. As he approached, he recognized him as a Mormon named\nCowper, to whom he had rendered services at different times. He\ntherefore accosted him when he got up to him, with the object of\nfinding out what Lucy Ferrier\u2019s fate had been.\n\n\u201cI am Jefferson Hope,\u201d he said. \u201cYou remember me.\u201d\n\nThe Mormon looked at him with undisguised astonishment\u2014indeed, it was\ndifficult to recognize in this tattered, unkempt wanderer, with ghastly\nwhite face and fierce, wild eyes, the spruce young hunter of former\ndays. Having, however, at last, satisfied himself as to his identity,\nthe man\u2019s surprise changed to consternation.\n\n\u201cYou are mad to come here,\u201d he cried. \u201cIt is as much as my own life is\nworth to be seen talking with you. There is a warrant against you from\nthe Holy Four for assisting the Ferriers away.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t fear them, or their warrant,\u201d Hope said, earnestly. \u201cYou must\nknow something of this matter, Cowper. I conjure you by everything you\nhold dear to answer a few questions. We have always been friends. For\nGod\u2019s sake, don\u2019t refuse to answer me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d the Mormon asked uneasily. \u201cBe quick. The very rocks have\nears and the trees eyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat has become of Lucy Ferrier?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was married yesterday to young Drebber. Hold up, man, hold up, you\nhave no life left in you.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind me,\u201d said Hope faintly. He was white to the very lips, and\nhad sunk down on the stone against which he had been leaning. \u201cMarried,\nyou say?\u201d\n\n\u201cMarried yesterday\u2014that\u2019s what those flags are for on the Endowment\nHouse. There was some words between young Drebber and young Stangerson\nas to which was to have her. They\u2019d both been in the party that\nfollowed them, and Stangerson had shot her father, which seemed to give\nhim the best claim; but when they argued it out in council, Drebber\u2019s\nparty was the stronger, so the Prophet gave her over to him. No one\nwon\u2019t have her very long though, for I saw death in her face yesterday.\nShe is more like a ghost than a woman. Are you off, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I am off,\u201d said Jefferson Hope, who had risen from his seat. His\nface might have been chiselled out of marble, so hard and set was its\nexpression, while its eyes glowed with a baleful light.\n\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\n\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d he answered; and, slinging his weapon over his shoulder,\nstrode off down the gorge and so away into the heart of the mountains\nto the haunts of the wild beasts. Amongst them all there was none so\nfierce and so dangerous as himself.\n\nThe prediction of the Mormon was only too well fulfilled. Whether it\nwas the terrible death of her father or the effects of the hateful\nmarriage into which she had been forced, poor Lucy never held up her\nhead again, but pined away and died within a month. Her sottish\nhusband, who had married her principally for the sake of John Ferrier\u2019s\nproperty, did not affect any great grief at his bereavement; but his\nother wives mourned over her, and sat up with her the night before the\nburial, as is the Mormon custom. They were grouped round the bier in\nthe early hours of the morning, when, to their inexpressible fear and\nastonishment, the door was flung open, and a savage-looking,\nweather-beaten man in tattered garments strode into the room. Without a\nglance or a word to the cowering women, he walked up to the white\nsilent figure which had once contained the pure soul of Lucy Ferrier.\nStooping over her, he pressed his lips reverently to her cold forehead,\nand then, snatching up her hand, he took the wedding-ring from her\nfinger. \u201cShe shall not be buried in that,\u201d he cried with a fierce\nsnarl, and before an alarm could be raised sprang down the stairs and\nwas gone. So strange and so brief was the episode, that the watchers\nmight have found it hard to believe it themselves or persuade other\npeople of it, had it not been for the undeniable fact that the circlet\nof gold which marked her as having been a bride had disappeared.\n\nFor some months Jefferson Hope lingered among the mountains, leading a\nstrange wild life, and nursing in his heart the fierce desire for\nvengeance which possessed him. Tales were told in the City of the weird\nfigure which was seen prowling about the suburbs, and which haunted the\nlonely mountain gorges. Once a bullet whistled through Stangerson\u2019s\nwindow and flattened itself upon the wall within a foot of him. On\nanother occasion, as Drebber passed under a cliff a great boulder\ncrashed down on him, and he only escaped a terrible death by throwing\nhimself upon his face. The two young Mormons were not long in\ndiscovering the reason of these attempts upon their lives, and led\nrepeated expeditions into the mountains in the hope of capturing or\nkilling their enemy, but always without success. Then they adopted the\nprecaution of never going out alone or after nightfall, and of having\ntheir houses guarded. After a time they were able to relax these\nmeasures, for nothing was either heard or seen of their opponent, and\nthey hoped that time had cooled his vindictiveness.\n\nFar from doing so, it had, if anything, augmented it. The hunter\u2019s mind\nwas of a hard, unyielding nature, and the predominant idea of revenge\nhad taken such complete possession of it that there was no room for any\nother emotion. He was, however, above all things practical. He soon\nrealized that even his iron constitution could not stand the incessant\nstrain which he was putting upon it. Exposure and want of wholesome\nfood were wearing him out. If he died like a dog among the mountains,\nwhat was to become of his revenge then? And yet such a death was sure\nto overtake him if he persisted. He felt that that was to play his\nenemy\u2019s game, so he reluctantly returned to the old Nevada mines, there\nto recruit his health and to amass money enough to allow him to pursue\nhis object without privation.\n\nHis intention had been to be absent a year at the most, but a\ncombination of unforeseen circumstances prevented his leaving the mines\nfor nearly five. At the end of that time, however, his memory of his\nwrongs and his craving for revenge were quite as keen as on that\nmemorable night when he had stood by John Ferrier\u2019s grave. Disguised,\nand under an assumed name, he returned to Salt Lake City, careless what\nbecame of his own life, as long as he obtained what he knew to be\njustice. There he found evil tidings awaiting him. There had been a\nschism among the Chosen People a few months before, some of the younger\nmembers of the Church having rebelled against the authority of the\nElders, and the result had been the secession of a certain number of\nthe malcontents, who had left Utah and become Gentiles. Among these had\nbeen Drebber and Stangerson; and no one knew whither they had gone.\nRumour reported that Drebber had managed to convert a large part of his\nproperty into money, and that he had departed a wealthy man, while his\ncompanion, Stangerson, was comparatively poor. There was no clue at\nall, however, as to their whereabouts.\n\nMany a man, however vindictive, would have abandoned all thought of\nrevenge in the face of such a difficulty, but Jefferson Hope never\nfaltered for a moment. With the small competence he possessed, eked out\nby such employment as he could pick up, he travelled from town to town\nthrough the United States in quest of his enemies. Year passed into\nyear, his black hair turned grizzled, but still he wandered on, a human\nbloodhound, with his mind wholly set upon the one object upon which he\nhad devoted his life. At last his perseverance was rewarded. It was but\na glance of a face in a window, but that one glance told him that\nCleveland in Ohio possessed the men whom he was in pursuit of. He\nreturned to his miserable lodgings with his plan of vengeance all\narranged. It chanced, however, that Drebber, looking from his window,\nhad recognized the vagrant in the street, and had read murder in his\neyes. He hurried before a justice of the peace, accompanied by\nStangerson, who had become his private secretary, and represented to\nhim that they were in danger of their lives from the jealousy and\nhatred of an old rival. That evening Jefferson Hope was taken into\ncustody, and not being able to find sureties, was detained for some\nweeks. When at last he was liberated, it was only to find that\nDrebber\u2019s house was deserted, and that he and his secretary had\ndeparted for Europe.\n\nAgain the avenger had been foiled, and again his concentrated hatred\nurged him to continue the pursuit. Funds were wanting, however, and for\nsome time he had to return to work, saving every dollar for his\napproaching journey. At last, having collected enough to keep life in\nhim, he departed for Europe, and tracked his enemies from city to city,\nworking his way in any menial capacity, but never overtaking the\nfugitives. When he reached St. Petersburg they had departed for Paris;\nand when he followed them there he learned that they had just set off\nfor Copenhagen. At the Danish capital he was again a few days late, for\nthey had journeyed on to London, where he at last succeeded in running\nthem to earth. As to what occurred there, we cannot do better than\nquote the old hunter\u2019s own account, as duly recorded in Dr. Watson\u2019s\nJournal, to which we are already under such obligations.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\nA CONTINUATION OF THE REMINISCENCES OF JOHN WATSON, M.D.\n\n\nOur prisoner\u2019s furious resistance did not apparently indicate any\nferocity in his disposition towards ourselves, for on finding himself\npowerless, he smiled in an affable manner, and expressed his hopes that\nhe had not hurt any of us in the scuffle. \u201cI guess you\u2019re going to take\nme to the police-station,\u201d he remarked to Sherlock Holmes. \u201cMy cab\u2019s at\nthe door. If you\u2019ll loose my legs I\u2019ll walk down to it. I\u2019m not so\nlight to lift as I used to be.\u201d\n\nGregson and Lestrade exchanged glances as if they thought this\nproposition rather a bold one; but Holmes at once took the prisoner at\nhis word, and loosened the towel which we had bound round his ankles.\nHe rose and stretched his legs, as though to assure himself that they\nwere free once more. I remember that I thought to myself, as I eyed\nhim, that I had seldom seen a more powerfully built man; and his dark\nsunburned face bore an expression of determination and energy which was\nas formidable as his personal strength.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a vacant place for a chief of the police, I reckon you are\nthe man for it,\u201d he said, gazing with undisguised admiration at my\nfellow-lodger. \u201cThe way you kept on my trail was a caution.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou had better come with me,\u201d said Holmes to the two detectives.\n\n\u201cI can drive you,\u201d said Lestrade.\n\n\u201cGood! and Gregson can come inside with me. You too, Doctor, you have\ntaken an interest in the case and may as well stick to us.\u201d\n\nI assented gladly, and we all descended together. Our prisoner made no\nattempt at escape, but stepped calmly into the cab which had been his,\nand we followed him. Lestrade mounted the box, whipped up the horse,\nand brought us in a very short time to our destination. We were ushered\ninto a small chamber where a police Inspector noted down our prisoner\u2019s\nname and the names of the men with whose murder he had been charged.\nThe official was a white-faced unemotional man, who went through his\nduties in a dull mechanical way. \u201cThe prisoner will be put before the\nmagistrates in the course of the week,\u201d he said; \u201cin the mean time, Mr.\nJefferson Hope, have you anything that you wish to say? I must warn you\nthat your words will be taken down, and may be used against you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a good deal to say,\u201d our prisoner said slowly. \u201cI want to\ntell you gentlemen all about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHadn\u2019t you better reserve that for your trial?\u201d asked the Inspector.\n\n\u201cI may never be tried,\u201d he answered. \u201cYou needn\u2019t look startled. It\nisn\u2019t suicide I am thinking of. Are you a Doctor?\u201d He turned his fierce\ndark eyes upon me as he asked this last question.\n\n\u201cYes; I am,\u201d I answered.\n\n\u201cThen put your hand here,\u201d he said, with a smile, motioning with his\nmanacled wrists towards his chest.\n\nI did so; and became at once conscious of an extraordinary throbbing\nand commotion which was going on inside. The walls of his chest seemed\nto thrill and quiver as a frail building would do inside when some\npowerful engine was at work. In the silence of the room I could hear a\ndull humming and buzzing noise which proceeded from the same source.\n\n\u201cWhy,\u201d I cried, \u201cyou have an aortic aneurism!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what they call it,\u201d he said, placidly. \u201cI went to a Doctor last\nweek about it, and he told me that it is bound to burst before many\ndays passed. It has been getting worse for years. I got it from\nover-exposure and under-feeding among the Salt Lake Mountains. I\u2019ve\ndone my work now, and I don\u2019t care how soon I go, but I should like to\nleave some account of the business behind me. I don\u2019t want to be\nremembered as a common cut-throat.\u201d\n\nThe Inspector and the two detectives had a hurried discussion as to the\nadvisability of allowing him to tell his story.\n\n\u201cDo you consider, Doctor, that there is immediate danger?\u201d the former\nasked.\n\n\u201cMost certainly there is,\u201d I answered.\n\n\u201cIn that case it is clearly our duty, in the interests of justice, to\ntake his statement,\u201d said the Inspector. \u201cYou are at liberty, sir, to\ngive your account, which I again warn you will be taken down.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll sit down, with your leave,\u201d the prisoner said, suiting the action\nto the word. \u201cThis aneurism of mine makes me easily tired, and the\ntussle we had half an hour ago has not mended matters. I\u2019m on the brink\nof the grave, and I am not likely to lie to you. Every word I say is\nthe absolute truth, and how you use it is a matter of no consequence to\nme.\u201d\n\nWith these words, Jefferson Hope leaned back in his chair and began the\nfollowing remarkable statement. He spoke in a calm and methodical\nmanner, as though the events which he narrated were commonplace enough.\nI can vouch for the accuracy of the subjoined account, for I have had\naccess to Lestrade\u2019s note-book, in which the prisoner\u2019s words were\ntaken down exactly as they were uttered.\n\n\u201cIt don\u2019t much matter to you why I hated these men,\u201d he said; \u201cit\u2019s\nenough that they were guilty of the death of two human beings\u2014a father\nand a daughter\u2014and that they had, therefore, forfeited their own lives.\nAfter the lapse of time that has passed since their crime, it was\nimpossible for me to secure a conviction against them in any court. I\nknew of their guilt though, and I determined that I should be judge,\njury, and executioner all rolled into one. You\u2019d have done the same, if\nyou have any manhood in you, if you had been in my place.\n\n\u201cThat girl that I spoke of was to have married me twenty years ago. She\nwas forced into marrying that same Drebber, and broke her heart over\nit. I took the marriage ring from her dead finger, and I vowed that his\ndying eyes should rest upon that very ring, and that his last thoughts\nshould be of the crime for which he was punished. I have carried it\nabout with me, and have followed him and his accomplice over two\ncontinents until I caught them. They thought to tire me out, but they\ncould not do it. If I die to-morrow, as is likely enough, I die knowing\nthat my work in this world is done, and well done. They have perished,\nand by my hand. There is nothing left for me to hope for, or to desire.\n\n\u201cThey were rich and I was poor, so that it was no easy matter for me to\nfollow them. When I got to London my pocket was about empty, and I\nfound that I must turn my hand to something for my living. Driving and\nriding are as natural to me as walking, so I applied at a cabowner\u2019s\noffice, and soon got employment. I was to bring a certain sum a week to\nthe owner, and whatever was over that I might keep for myself. There\nwas seldom much over, but I managed to scrape along somehow. The\nhardest job was to learn my way about, for I reckon that of all the\nmazes that ever were contrived, this city is the most confusing. I had\na map beside me though, and when once I had spotted the principal\nhotels and stations, I got on pretty well.\n\n\u201cIt was some time before I found out where my two gentlemen were\nliving; but I inquired and inquired until at last I dropped across\nthem. They were at a boarding-house at Camberwell, over on the other\nside of the river. When once I found them out I knew that I had them at\nmy mercy. I had grown my beard, and there was no chance of their\nrecognizing me. I would dog them and follow them until I saw my\nopportunity. I was determined that they should not escape me again.\n\n\u201cThey were very near doing it for all that. Go where they would about\nLondon, I was always at their heels. Sometimes I followed them on my\ncab, and sometimes on foot, but the former was the best, for then they\ncould not get away from me. It was only early in the morning or late at\nnight that I could earn anything, so that I began to get behind hand\nwith my employer. I did not mind that, however, as long as I could lay\nmy hand upon the men I wanted.\n\n\u201cThey were very cunning, though. They must have thought that there was\nsome chance of their being followed, for they would never go out alone,\nand never after nightfall. During two weeks I drove behind them every\nday, and never once saw them separate. Drebber himself was drunk half\nthe time, but Stangerson was not to be caught napping. I watched them\nlate and early, but never saw the ghost of a chance; but I was not\ndiscouraged, for something told me that the hour had almost come. My\nonly fear was that this thing in my chest might burst a little too soon\nand leave my work undone.\n\n\u201cAt last, one evening I was driving up and down Torquay Terrace, as the\nstreet was called in which they boarded, when I saw a cab drive up to\ntheir door. Presently some luggage was brought out, and after a time\nDrebber and Stangerson followed it, and drove off. I whipped up my\nhorse and kept within sight of them, feeling very ill at ease, for I\nfeared that they were going to shift their quarters. At Euston Station\nthey got out, and I left a boy to hold my horse, and followed them on\nto the platform. I heard them ask for the Liverpool train, and the\nguard answer that one had just gone and there would not be another for\nsome hours. Stangerson seemed to be put out at that, but Drebber was\nrather pleased than otherwise. I got so close to them in the bustle\nthat I could hear every word that passed between them. Drebber said\nthat he had a little business of his own to do, and that if the other\nwould wait for him he would soon rejoin him. His companion remonstrated\nwith him, and reminded him that they had resolved to stick together.\nDrebber answered that the matter was a delicate one, and that he must\ngo alone. I could not catch what Stangerson said to that, but the other\nburst out swearing, and reminded him that he was nothing more than his\npaid servant, and that he must not presume to dictate to him. On that\nthe Secretary gave it up as a bad job, and simply bargained with him\nthat if he missed the last train he should rejoin him at Halliday\u2019s\nPrivate Hotel; to which Drebber answered that he would be back on the\nplatform before eleven, and made his way out of the station.\n\n\u201cThe moment for which I had waited so long had at last come. I had my\nenemies within my power. Together they could protect each other, but\nsingly they were at my mercy. I did not act, however, with undue\nprecipitation. My plans were already formed. There is no satisfaction\nin vengeance unless the offender has time to realize who it is that\nstrikes him, and why retribution has come upon him. I had my plans\narranged by which I should have the opportunity of making the man who\nhad wronged me understand that his old sin had found him out. It\nchanced that some days before a gentleman who had been engaged in\nlooking over some houses in the Brixton Road had dropped the key of one\nof them in my carriage. It was claimed that same evening, and returned;\nbut in the interval I had taken a moulding of it, and had a duplicate\nconstructed. By means of this I had access to at least one spot in this\ngreat city where I could rely upon being free from interruption. How to\nget Drebber to that house was the difficult problem which I had now to\nsolve.\n\n\u201cHe walked down the road and went into one or two liquor shops, staying\nfor nearly half-an-hour in the last of them. When he came out he\nstaggered in his walk, and was evidently pretty well on. There was a\nhansom just in front of me, and he hailed it. I followed it so close\nthat the nose of my horse was within a yard of his driver the whole\nway. We rattled across Waterloo Bridge and through miles of streets,\nuntil, to my astonishment, we found ourselves back in the Terrace in\nwhich he had boarded. I could not imagine what his intention was in\nreturning there; but I went on and pulled up my cab a hundred yards or\nso from the house. He entered it, and his hansom drove away. Give me a\nglass of water, if you please. My mouth gets dry with the talking.\u201d\n\nI handed him the glass, and he drank it down.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, I waited for a quarter of an hour, or\nmore, when suddenly there came a noise like people struggling inside\nthe house. Next moment the door was flung open and two men appeared,\none of whom was Drebber, and the other was a young chap whom I had\nnever seen before. This fellow had Drebber by the collar, and when they\ncame to the head of the steps he gave him a shove and a kick which sent\nhim half across the road. \u2018You hound,\u2019 he cried, shaking his stick at\nhim; \u2018I\u2019ll teach you to insult an honest girl!\u2019 He was so hot that I\nthink he would have thrashed Drebber with his cudgel, only that the cur\nstaggered away down the road as fast as his legs would carry him. He\nran as far as the corner, and then, seeing my cab, he hailed me and\njumped in. \u2018Drive me to Halliday\u2019s Private Hotel,\u2019 said he.\n\n\u201cWhen I had him fairly inside my cab, my heart jumped so with joy that\nI feared lest at this last moment my aneurism might go wrong. I drove\nalong slowly, weighing in my own mind what it was best to do. I might\ntake him right out into the country, and there in some deserted lane\nhave my last interview with him. I had almost decided upon this, when\nhe solved the problem for me. The craze for drink had seized him again,\nand he ordered me to pull up outside a gin palace. He went in, leaving\nword that I should wait for him. There he remained until closing time,\nand when he came out he was so far gone that I knew the game was in my\nown hands.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t imagine that I intended to kill him in cold blood. It would only\nhave been rigid justice if I had done so, but I could not bring myself\nto do it. I had long determined that he should have a show for his life\nif he chose to take advantage of it. Among the many billets which I\nhave filled in America during my wandering life, I was once janitor and\nsweeper out of the laboratory at York College. One day the professor\nwas lecturing on poisons, and he showed his students some alkaloid, as\nhe called it, which he had extracted from some South American arrow\npoison, and which was so powerful that the least grain meant instant\ndeath. I spotted the bottle in which this preparation was kept, and\nwhen they were all gone, I helped myself to a little of it. I was a\nfairly good dispenser, so I worked this alkaloid into small, soluble\npills, and each pill I put in a box with a similar pill made without\nthe poison. I determined at the time that when I had my chance, my\ngentlemen should each have a draw out of one of these boxes, while I\nate the pill that remained. It would be quite as deadly, and a good\ndeal less noisy than firing across a handkerchief. From that day I had\nalways my pill boxes about with me, and the time had now come when I\nwas to use them.\n\n\u201cIt was nearer one than twelve, and a wild, bleak night, blowing hard\nand raining in torrents. Dismal as it was outside, I was glad within\u2014so\nglad that I could have shouted out from pure exultation. If any of you\ngentlemen have ever pined for a thing, and longed for it during twenty\nlong years, and then suddenly found it within your reach, you would\nunderstand my feelings. I lit a cigar, and puffed at it to steady my\nnerves, but my hands were trembling, and my temples throbbing with\nexcitement. As I drove, I could see old John Ferrier and sweet Lucy\nlooking at me out of the darkness and smiling at me, just as plain as I\nsee you all in this room. All the way they were ahead of me, one on\neach side of the horse until I pulled up at the house in the Brixton\nRoad.\n\n\u201cThere was not a soul to be seen, nor a sound to be heard, except the\ndripping of the rain. When I looked in at the window, I found Drebber\nall huddled together in a drunken sleep. I shook him by the arm, \u2018It\u2019s\ntime to get out,\u2019 I said.\n\n\u201c\u2018All right, cabby,\u2019 said he.\n\n\u201cI suppose he thought we had come to the hotel that he had mentioned,\nfor he got out without another word, and followed me down the garden. I\nhad to walk beside him to keep him steady, for he was still a little\ntop-heavy. When we came to the door, I opened it, and led him into the\nfront room. I give you my word that all the way, the father and the\ndaughter were walking in front of us.\n\n\u201c\u2018It\u2019s infernally dark,\u2019 said he, stamping about.\n\n\u201c\u2018We\u2019ll soon have a light,\u2019 I said, striking a match and putting it to\na wax candle which I had brought with me. \u2018Now, Enoch Drebber,\u2019 I\ncontinued, turning to him, and holding the light to my own face, \u2018who\nam I?\u2019\n\n\u201cHe gazed at me with bleared, drunken eyes for a moment, and then I saw\na horror spring up in them, and convulse his whole features, which\nshowed me that he knew me. He staggered back with a livid face, and I\nsaw the perspiration break out upon his brow, while his teeth chattered\nin his head. At the sight, I leaned my back against the door and\nlaughed loud and long. I had always known that vengeance would be\nsweet, but I had never hoped for the contentment of soul which now\npossessed me.\n\n\u201c\u2018You dog!\u2019 I said; \u2018I have hunted you from Salt Lake City to St.\nPetersburg, and you have always escaped me. Now, at last your\nwanderings have come to an end, for either you or I shall never see\nto-morrow\u2019s sun rise.\u2019 He shrunk still further away as I spoke, and I\ncould see on his face that he thought I was mad. So I was for the time.\nThe pulses in my temples beat like sledge-hammers, and I believe I\nwould have had a fit of some sort if the blood had not gushed from my\nnose and relieved me.\n\n\u201c\u2018What do you think of Lucy Ferrier now?\u2019 I cried, locking the door,\nand shaking the key in his face. \u2018Punishment has been slow in coming,\nbut it has overtaken you at last.\u2019 I saw his coward lips tremble as I\nspoke. He would have begged for his life, but he knew well that it was\nuseless.\n\n\u201c\u2018Would you murder me?\u2019 he stammered.\n\n\u201c\u2018There is no murder,\u2019 I answered. \u2018Who talks of murdering a mad dog?\nWhat mercy had you upon my poor darling, when you dragged her from her\nslaughtered father, and bore her away to your accursed and shameless\nharem.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018It was not I who killed her father,\u2019 he cried.\n\n\u201c\u2018But it was you who broke her innocent heart,\u2019 I shrieked, thrusting\nthe box before him. \u2018Let the high God judge between us. Choose and eat.\nThere is death in one and life in the other. I shall take what you\nleave. Let us see if there is justice upon the earth, or if we are\nruled by chance.\u2019\n\n\u201cHe cowered away with wild cries and prayers for mercy, but I drew my\nknife and held it to his throat until he had obeyed me. Then I\nswallowed the other, and we stood facing one another in silence for a\nminute or more, waiting to see which was to live and which was to die.\nShall I ever forget the look which came over his face when the first\nwarning pangs told him that the poison was in his system? I laughed as\nI saw it, and held Lucy\u2019s marriage ring in front of his eyes. It was\nbut for a moment, for the action of the alkaloid is rapid. A spasm of\npain contorted his features; he threw his hands out in front of him,\nstaggered, and then, with a hoarse cry, fell heavily upon the floor. I\nturned him over with my foot, and placed my hand upon his heart. There\nwas no movement. He was dead!\n\n\u201cThe blood had been streaming from my nose, but I had taken no notice\nof it. I don\u2019t know what it was that put it into my head to write upon\nthe wall with it. Perhaps it was some mischievous idea of setting the\npolice upon a wrong track, for I felt light-hearted and cheerful. I\nremembered a German being found in New York with RACHE written up above\nhim, and it was argued at the time in the newspapers that the secret\nsocieties must have done it. I guessed that what puzzled the New\nYorkers would puzzle the Londoners, so I dipped my finger in my own\nblood and printed it on a convenient place on the wall. Then I walked\ndown to my cab and found that there was nobody about, and that the\nnight was still very wild. I had driven some distance when I put my\nhand into the pocket in which I usually kept Lucy\u2019s ring, and found\nthat it was not there. I was thunderstruck at this, for it was the only\nmemento that I had of her. Thinking that I might have dropped it when I\nstooped over Drebber\u2019s body, I drove back, and leaving my cab in a side\nstreet, I went boldly up to the house\u2014for I was ready to dare anything\nrather than lose the ring. When I arrived there, I walked right into\nthe arms of a police-officer who was coming out, and only managed to\ndisarm his suspicions by pretending to be hopelessly drunk.\n\n\u201cThat was how Enoch Drebber came to his end. All I had to do then was\nto do as much for Stangerson, and so pay off John Ferrier\u2019s debt. I\nknew that he was staying at Halliday\u2019s Private Hotel, and I hung about\nall day, but he never came out. I fancy that he suspected something\nwhen Drebber failed to put in an appearance. He was cunning, was\nStangerson, and always on his guard. If he thought he could keep me off\nby staying indoors he was very much mistaken. I soon found out which\nwas the window of his bedroom, and early next morning I took advantage\nof some ladders which were lying in the lane behind the hotel, and so\nmade my way into his room in the grey of the dawn. I woke him up and\ntold him that the hour had come when he was to answer for the life he\nhad taken so long before. I described Drebber\u2019s death to him, and I\ngave him the same choice of the poisoned pills. Instead of grasping at\nthe chance of safety which that offered him, he sprang from his bed and\nflew at my throat. In self-defence I stabbed him to the heart. It would\nhave been the same in any case, for Providence would never have allowed\nhis guilty hand to pick out anything but the poison.\n\n\u201cI have little more to say, and it\u2019s as well, for I am about done up. I\nwent on cabbing it for a day or so, intending to keep at it until I\ncould save enough to take me back to America. I was standing in the\nyard when a ragged youngster asked if there was a cabby there called\nJefferson Hope, and said that his cab was wanted by a gentleman at\n221B, Baker Street. I went round, suspecting no harm, and the next\nthing I knew, this young man here had the bracelets on my wrists, and\nas neatly shackled as ever I saw in my life. That\u2019s the whole of my\nstory, gentlemen. You may consider me to be a murderer; but I hold that\nI am just as much an officer of justice as you are.\u201d\n\nSo thrilling had the man\u2019s narrative been, and his manner was so\nimpressive that we had sat silent and absorbed. Even the professional\ndetectives, _blas\u00e9_ as they were in every detail of crime, appeared to\nbe keenly interested in the man\u2019s story. When he finished we sat for\nsome minutes in a stillness which was only broken by the scratching of\nLestrade\u2019s pencil as he gave the finishing touches to his shorthand\naccount.\n\n\u201cThere is only one point on which I should like a little more\ninformation,\u201d Sherlock Holmes said at last. \u201cWho was your accomplice\nwho came for the ring which I advertised?\u201d\n\nThe prisoner winked at my friend jocosely. \u201cI can tell my own secrets,\u201d\nhe said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t get other people into trouble. I saw your\nadvertisement, and I thought it might be a plant, or it might be the\nring which I wanted. My friend volunteered to go and see. I think\nyou\u2019ll own he did it smartly.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a doubt of that,\u201d said Holmes heartily.\n\n\u201cNow, gentlemen,\u201d the Inspector remarked gravely, \u201cthe forms of the law\nmust be complied with. On Thursday the prisoner will be brought before\nthe magistrates, and your attendance will be required. Until then I\nwill be responsible for him.\u201d He rang the bell as he spoke, and\nJefferson Hope was led off by a couple of warders, while my friend and\nI made our way out of the Station and took a cab back to Baker Street.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\nTHE CONCLUSION.\n\n\nWe had all been warned to appear before the magistrates upon the\nThursday; but when the Thursday came there was no occasion for our\ntestimony. A higher Judge had taken the matter in hand, and Jefferson\nHope had been summoned before a tribunal where strict justice would be\nmeted out to him. On the very night after his capture the aneurism\nburst, and he was found in the morning stretched upon the floor of the\ncell, with a placid smile upon his face, as though he had been able in\nhis dying moments to look back upon a useful life, and on work well\ndone.\n\n\u201cGregson and Lestrade will be wild about his death,\u201d Holmes remarked,\nas we chatted it over next evening. \u201cWhere will their grand\nadvertisement be now?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see that they had very much to do with his capture,\u201d I\nanswered.\n\n\u201cWhat you do in this world is a matter of no consequence,\u201d returned my\ncompanion, bitterly. \u201cThe question is, what can you make people believe\nthat you have done. Never mind,\u201d he continued, more brightly, after a\npause. \u201cI would not have missed the investigation for anything. There\nhas been no better case within my recollection. Simple as it was, there\nwere several most instructive points about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSimple!\u201d I ejaculated.\n\n\u201cWell, really, it can hardly be described as otherwise,\u201d said Sherlock\nHolmes, smiling at my surprise. \u201cThe proof of its intrinsic simplicity\nis, that without any help save a few very ordinary deductions I was\nable to lay my hand upon the criminal within three days.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is true,\u201d said I.\n\n\u201cI have already explained to you that what is out of the common is\nusually a guide rather than a hindrance. In solving a problem of this\nsort, the grand thing is to be able to reason backwards. That is a very\nuseful accomplishment, and a very easy one, but people do not practise\nit much. In the every-day affairs of life it is more useful to reason\nforwards, and so the other comes to be neglected. There are fifty who\ncan reason synthetically for one who can reason analytically.\u201d\n\n\u201cI confess,\u201d said I, \u201cthat I do not quite follow you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hardly expected that you would. Let me see if I can make it clearer.\nMost people, if you describe a train of events to them, will tell you\nwhat the result would be. They can put those events together in their\nminds, and argue from them that something will come to pass. There are\nfew people, however, who, if you told them a result, would be able to\nevolve from their own inner consciousness what the steps were which led\nup to that result. This power is what I mean when I talk of reasoning\nbackwards, or analytically.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand,\u201d said I.\n\n\u201cNow this was a case in which you were given the result and had to find\neverything else for yourself. Now let me endeavour to show you the\ndifferent steps in my reasoning. To begin at the beginning. I\napproached the house, as you know, on foot, and with my mind entirely\nfree from all impressions. I naturally began by examining the roadway,\nand there, as I have already explained to you, I saw clearly the marks\nof a cab, which, I ascertained by inquiry, must have been there during\nthe night. I satisfied myself that it was a cab and not a private\ncarriage by the narrow gauge of the wheels. The ordinary London growler\nis considerably less wide than a gentleman\u2019s brougham.\n\n\u201cThis was the first point gained. I then walked slowly down the garden\npath, which happened to be composed of a clay soil, peculiarly suitable\nfor taking impressions. No doubt it appeared to you to be a mere\ntrampled line of slush, but to my trained eyes every mark upon its\nsurface had a meaning. There is no branch of detective science which is\nso important and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps.\nHappily, I have always laid great stress upon it, and much practice has\nmade it second nature to me. I saw the heavy footmarks of the\nconstables, but I saw also the track of the two men who had first\npassed through the garden. It was easy to tell that they had been\nbefore the others, because in places their marks had been entirely\nobliterated by the others coming upon the top of them. In this way my\nsecond link was formed, which told me that the nocturnal visitors were\ntwo in number, one remarkable for his height (as I calculated from the\nlength of his stride), and the other fashionably dressed, to judge from\nthe small and elegant impression left by his boots.\n\n\u201cOn entering the house this last inference was confirmed. My\nwell-booted man lay before me. The tall one, then, had done the murder,\nif murder there was. There was no wound upon the dead man\u2019s person, but\nthe agitated expression upon his face assured me that he had foreseen\nhis fate before it came upon him. Men who die from heart disease, or\nany sudden natural cause, never by any chance exhibit agitation upon\ntheir features. Having sniffed the dead man\u2019s lips I detected a\nslightly sour smell, and I came to the conclusion that he had had\npoison forced upon him. Again, I argued that it had been forced upon\nhim from the hatred and fear expressed upon his face. By the method of\nexclusion, I had arrived at this result, for no other hypothesis would\nmeet the facts. Do not imagine that it was a very unheard of idea. The\nforcible administration of poison is by no means a new thing in\ncriminal annals. The cases of Dolsky in Odessa, and of Leturier in\nMontpellier, will occur at once to any toxicologist.\n\n\u201cAnd now came the great question as to the reason why. Robbery had not\nbeen the object of the murder, for nothing was taken. Was it politics,\nthen, or was it a woman? That was the question which confronted me. I\nwas inclined from the first to the latter supposition. Political\nassassins are only too glad to do their work and to fly. This murder\nhad, on the contrary, been done most deliberately, and the perpetrator\nhad left his tracks all over the room, showing that he had been there\nall the time. It must have been a private wrong, and not a political\none, which called for such a methodical revenge. When the inscription\nwas discovered upon the wall I was more inclined than ever to my\nopinion. The thing was too evidently a blind. When the ring was found,\nhowever, it settled the question. Clearly the murderer had used it to\nremind his victim of some dead or absent woman. It was at this point\nthat I asked Gregson whether he had enquired in his telegram to\nCleveland as to any particular point in Mr. Drebber\u2019s former career. He\nanswered, you remember, in the negative.\n\n\u201cI then proceeded to make a careful examination of the room, which\nconfirmed me in my opinion as to the murderer\u2019s height, and furnished\nme with the additional details as to the Trichinopoly cigar and the\nlength of his nails. I had already come to the conclusion, since there\nwere no signs of a struggle, that the blood which covered the floor had\nburst from the murderer\u2019s nose in his excitement. I could perceive that\nthe track of blood coincided with the track of his feet. It is seldom\nthat any man, unless he is very full-blooded, breaks out in this way\nthrough emotion, so I hazarded the opinion that the criminal was\nprobably a robust and ruddy-faced man. Events proved that I had judged\ncorrectly.\n\n\u201cHaving left the house, I proceeded to do what Gregson had neglected. I\ntelegraphed to the head of the police at Cleveland, limiting my enquiry\nto the circumstances connected with the marriage of Enoch Drebber. The\nanswer was conclusive. It told me that Drebber had already applied for\nthe protection of the law against an old rival in love, named Jefferson\nHope, and that this same Hope was at present in Europe. I knew now that\nI held the clue to the mystery in my hand, and all that remained was to\nsecure the murderer.\n\n\u201cI had already determined in my own mind that the man who had walked\ninto the house with Drebber, was none other than the man who had driven\nthe cab. The marks in the road showed me that the horse had wandered on\nin a way which would have been impossible had there been anyone in\ncharge of it. Where, then, could the driver be, unless he were inside\nthe house? Again, it is absurd to suppose that any sane man would carry\nout a deliberate crime under the very eyes, as it were, of a third\nperson, who was sure to betray him. Lastly, supposing one man wished to\ndog another through London, what better means could he adopt than to\nturn cabdriver. All these considerations led me to the irresistible\nconclusion that Jefferson Hope was to be found among the jarveys of the\nMetropolis.\n\n\u201cIf he had been one there was no reason to believe that he had ceased\nto be. On the contrary, from his point of view, any sudden change would\nbe likely to draw attention to himself. He would, probably, for a time\nat least, continue to perform his duties. There was no reason to\nsuppose that he was going under an assumed name. Why should he change\nhis name in a country where no one knew his original one? I therefore\norganized my Street Arab detective corps, and sent them systematically\nto every cab proprietor in London until they ferreted out the man that\nI wanted. How well they succeeded, and how quickly I took advantage of\nit, are still fresh in your recollection. The murder of Stangerson was\nan incident which was entirely unexpected, but which could hardly in\nany case have been prevented. Through it, as you know, I came into\npossession of the pills, the existence of which I had already surmised.\nYou see the whole thing is a chain of logical sequences without a break\nor flaw.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is wonderful!\u201d I cried. \u201cYour merits should be publicly recognized.\nYou should publish an account of the case. If you won\u2019t, I will for\nyou.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou may do what you like, Doctor,\u201d he answered. \u201cSee here!\u201d he\ncontinued, handing a paper over to me, \u201clook at this!\u201d\n\nIt was the _Echo_ for the day, and the paragraph to which he pointed\nwas devoted to the case in question.\n\n\u201cThe public,\u201d it said, \u201chave lost a sensational treat through the\nsudden death of the man Hope, who was suspected of the murder of Mr.\nEnoch Drebber and of Mr. Joseph Stangerson. The details of the case\nwill probably be never known now, though we are informed upon good\nauthority that the crime was the result of an old standing and romantic\nfeud, in which love and Mormonism bore a part. It seems that both the\nvictims belonged, in their younger days, to the Latter Day Saints, and\nHope, the deceased prisoner, hails also from Salt Lake City. If the\ncase has had no other effect, it, at least, brings out in the most\nstriking manner the efficiency of our detective police force, and will\nserve as a lesson to all foreigners that they will do wisely to settle\ntheir feuds at home, and not to carry them on to British soil. It is an\nopen secret that the credit of this smart capture belongs entirely to\nthe well-known Scotland Yard officials, Messrs. Lestrade and Gregson.\nThe man was apprehended, it appears, in the rooms of a certain Mr.\nSherlock Holmes, who has himself, as an amateur, shown some talent in\nthe detective line, and who, with such instructors, may hope in time to\nattain to some degree of their skill. It is expected that a testimonial\nof some sort will be presented to the two officers as a fitting\nrecognition of their services.\u201d\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you so when we started?\u201d cried Sherlock Holmes with a\nlaugh. \u201cThat\u2019s the result of all our Study in Scarlet: to get them a\ntestimonial!\u201d\n\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d I answered, \u201cI have all the facts in my journal, and the\npublic shall know them. In the meantime you must make yourself\ncontented by the consciousness of success, like the Roman miser\u2014\n\n\n\u201c\u2018Populus me sibilat, at mihi plaudo\nIpse domi simul ac nummos contemplor in arca.\u2019\u201d"}
