    "For longer text documents, like those found in Project Gutenberg, it's not practical to use them in their entirety for retrieval and training large language models. Therefore, it's essential to divide them into smaller pieces. However, this process should strike a balance between the size (number of tokens) and the semantic coherence of these smaller segments. Smaller splits can result in numerous fragmented but semantically related pieces, while larger splits may obscure the document's semantics. Achieving the right balance is crucial for effective document processing and understanding."

SHERLOCK HOLMES.\\n\\n\\nIn the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the\\nUniversity of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course\\nprescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there,\\nI was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant\\nSurgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before I\\ncould join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at\\nBombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and\\nwas already deep in the enemy’s country. I followed, however, with many\\nother officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded\\nin reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once\\nentered upon my new duties.\\n\\nThe campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had\\nnothing but misfortune and disaster.

      "'campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had\\nnothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and\\nattached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of\\nMaiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which\\nshattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should have\\nfallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the\\ndevotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a\\npack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.\\n\\nWorn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had\\nundergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to\\nthe base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improved\\nso far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little\\nupon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse\\nof our Indian possessions.

      "'the wards, and even to bask a little\\nupon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse\\nof our Indian possessions. For months my life was despaired of, and\\nwhen at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak\\nand emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be\\nlost in sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in\\nthe troopship “Orontes,” and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty,\\nwith my health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a\\npaternal government to spend the next nine months in attempting to\\nimprove it.\\n\\nI had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as\\nair—or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will\\npermit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to\\nLondon, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of\\nthe Empire are irresistibly drained.

      "'gravitated to\\nLondon, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of\\nthe Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time at a\\nprivate hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless\\nexistence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely\\nthan I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances become, that I\\nsoon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate\\nsomewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in\\nmy style of living. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making\\nup my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less\\npretentious and less expensive domicile.\\n\\nOn the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at\\nthe Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning\\nround I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at\\nBarts.

      "'on the shoulder, and turning\\nround I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at\\nBarts. The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London\\nis a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In old days Stamford had\\nnever been a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with\\nenthusiasm, and he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me. In\\nthe exuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn,\\nand we started off together in a hansom.\\n\\n“Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?” he asked in\\nundisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets.\\n“You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.”\\n\\nI gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded it\\nby the time that we reached our destination.\\n\\n“Poor devil!” he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my\\nmisfortunes. “What are you up to now?”\\n\\n“Looking for lodgings,” I answered. “Trying to solve the problem as to\\nwhether it is possible to'\n",
      "'devil!” he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my\\nmisfortunes. “What are you up to now?”\\n\\n“Looking for lodgings,” I answered. “Trying to solve the problem as to\\nwhether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable price.”\\n\\n“That’s a strange thing,” remarked my companion; “you are the second\\nman to-day that has used that expression to me.”\\n\\n“And who was the first?” I asked.\\n\\n“A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital.\\nHe was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone\\nto go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found, and which\\nwere too much for his purse.”\\n\\n“By Jove!” I cried, “if he really wants someone to share the rooms and\\nthe expense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a\\npartner to being alone.”\\n\\nYoung Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass. “You\\ndon’t know Sherlock Holmes yet,” he said; “perhaps you would not care\\nfor him as a constant companion.”\\n\\n“Why, what is'\n",
      "'alone.”\\n\\nYoung Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass. “You\\ndon’t know Sherlock Holmes yet,” he said; “perhaps you would not care\\nfor him as a constant companion.”\\n\\n“Why, what is there against him?”\\n\\n“Oh, I didn’t say there was anything against him. He is a little queer\\nin his ideas—an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as I\\nknow he is a decent fellow enough.”\\n\\n“A medical student, I suppose?” said I.\\n\\n“No—I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is well\\nup in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I know,\\nhe has never taken out any systematic medical classes.

      "'THE CONCLUSION.\\n\\nA STUDY IN SCARLET.\\n\\nPART I.\\n\\n(_Being a reprint from the Reminiscences of_ JOHN H. WATSON, M.D.,\\n_Late of the Army Medical Department._)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I.\\nMR. SHERLOCK HOLMES.\\n\\nIn the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the\\nUniversity of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course\\nprescribed for surgeons in the army.\\n\\nHaving completed my studies there,\\nI was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant\\nSurgeon.\\n\\nThe regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before I\\ncould join it, the second Afghan war had broken out.\\n\\nOn landing at\\nBombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and\\nwas already deep in the enemy’s country.\\n\\nI followed, however, with many\\nother officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded\\nin reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once\\nentered upon my new duties.'\n",
      "'I followed, however, with many\\nother officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded\\nin reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once\\nentered upon my new duties.\\n\\nThe campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had\\nnothing but misfortune and disaster.\\n\\nI was removed from my brigade and\\nattached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of\\nMaiwand.\\n\\nThere I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which\\nshattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery.\\n\\nI should have\\nfallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the\\ndevotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a\\npack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.\\n\\nWorn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had\\nundergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to\\nthe base hospital at Peshawar.'\n",
      "'Worn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had\\nundergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to\\nthe base hospital at Peshawar.\\n\\nHere I rallied, and had already improved\\nso far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little\\nupon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse\\nof our Indian possessions.\\n\\nFor months my life was despaired of, and\\nwhen at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak\\nand emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be\\nlost in sending me back to England.\\n\\nI was dispatched, accordingly, in\\nthe troopship “Orontes,” and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty,\\nwith my health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a\\npaternal government to spend the next nine months in attempting to\\nimprove it.'\n",
      "'I had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as\\nair—or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will\\npermit a man to be.\\n\\nUnder such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to\\nLondon, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of\\nthe Empire are irresistibly drained.\\n\\nThere I stayed for some time at a\\nprivate hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless\\nexistence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely\\nthan I ought.\\n\\nSo alarming did the state of my finances become, that I\\nsoon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate\\nsomewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in\\nmy style of living.\\n\\nChoosing the latter alternative, I began by making\\nup my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less\\npretentious and less expensive domicile.'\n",
      "'Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making\\nup my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less\\npretentious and less expensive domicile.\\n\\nOn the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at\\nthe Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning\\nround I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at\\nBarts.\\n\\nThe sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London\\nis a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man.\\n\\nIn old days Stamford had\\nnever been a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with\\nenthusiasm, and he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me.\\n\\nIn\\nthe exuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn,\\nand we started off together in a hansom.\\n\\n“Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?” he asked in\\nundisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets.'\n",
      "'“Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?” he asked in\\nundisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets.\\n\\n“You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.”\\n\\nI gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded it\\nby the time that we reached our destination.\\n\\n“Poor devil!” he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my\\nmisfortunes.\\n\\n“What are you up to now?”\\n\\n“Looking for lodgings,” I answered.\\n\\n“Trying to solve the problem as to\\nwhether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable price.”\\n\\n“That’s a strange thing,” remarked my companion; “you are the second\\nman to-day that has used that expression to me.”\\n\\n“And who was the first?” I asked.\\n\\n“A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital.'\n",
      "'“A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital.\\n\\nHe was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone\\nto go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found, and which\\nwere too much for his purse.”\\n\\n“By Jove!” I cried, “if he really wants someone to share the rooms and\\nthe expense, I am the very man for him.\\n\\nI should prefer having a\\npartner to being alone.”\\n\\nYoung Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass.\\n\\n“You\\ndon’t know Sherlock Holmes yet,” he said; “perhaps you would not care\\nfor him as a constant companion.”\\n\\n“Why, what is there against him?”\\n\\n“Oh, I didn’t say there was anything against him.\\n\\nHe is a little queer\\nin his ideas—an enthusiast in some branches of science.\\n\\nAs far as I\\nknow he is a decent fellow enough.”\\n\\n“A medical student, I suppose?” said I.\\n\\n“No—I have no idea what he intends to go in for.'\n",
      "'As far as I\\nknow he is a decent fellow enough.”\\n\\n“A medical student, I suppose?” said I.\\n\\n“No—I have no idea what he intends to go in for.\\n\\nI believe he is well\\nup in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I know,\\nhe has never taken out any systematic medical classes.\\n\\nHis studies are\\nvery desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the\\nway knowledge which would astonish his professors.”\\n\\n“Did you never ask him what he was going in for?” I asked.\\n\\n“No; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be\\ncommunicative enough when the fancy seizes him.”\\n\\n“I should like to meet him,” I said.\\n\\n“If I am to lodge with anyone, I\\nshould prefer a man of studious and quiet habits.\\n\\nI am not strong\\nenough yet to stand much noise or excitement.\\n\\nI had enough of both in\\nAfghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence.\\n\\nHow\\ncould I meet this friend of yours?”\\n\\n“He is sure to be at the laboratory,” returned my companion.'\n",
      "'I had enough of both in\\nAfghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence.\\n\\nHow\\ncould I meet this friend of yours?”\\n\\n“He is sure to be at the laboratory,” returned my companion.\\n\\n“He either\\navoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from morning to\\nnight.\\n\\nIf you like, we shall drive round together after luncheon.”\\n\\n“Certainly,” I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other\\nchannels.\\n\\nAs we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn, Stamford\\ngave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to\\ntake as a fellow-lodger.\\n\\n“You mustn’t blame me if you don’t get on with him,” he said; “I know\\nnothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally\\nin the laboratory.\\n\\nYou proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold\\nme responsible.”\\n\\n“If we don’t get on it will be easy to part company,” I answered.'\n",

      "'A STUDY IN SCARLET.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPART I.\\n\\n\\n(_Being a reprint from the Reminiscences of_ JOHN H. WATSON, M.D.,\\n_Late of the Army Medical Department._)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I.\\nMR.\\n\\nSHERLOCK HOLMES.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the\\nUniversity of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course\\nprescribed for surgeons in the army.\\n\\nHaving completed my studies there,\\nI was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant\\nSurgeon.\\n\\nThe regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before I\\ncould join it, the second Afghan war had broken out.\\n\\nOn landing at\\nBombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and\\nwas already deep in the enemy’s country.\\n\\nI followed, however, with many\\nother officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded\\nin reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once\\nentered upon my new duties.'\n",
      "'The campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had\\nnothing but misfortune and disaster.\\n\\nI was removed from my brigade and\\nattached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of\\nMaiwand.\\n\\nThere I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which\\nshattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery.\\n\\nI should have\\nfallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the\\ndevotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a\\npack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.\\n\\n\\n\\nWorn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had\\nundergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to\\nthe base hospital at Peshawar.\\n\\nHere I rallied, and had already improved\\nso far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little\\nupon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse\\nof our Indian possessions.'\n",
      "'For months my life was despaired of, and\\nwhen at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak\\nand emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be\\nlost in sending me back to England.\\n\\nI was dispatched, accordingly, in\\nthe troopship “Orontes,” and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty,\\nwith my health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a\\npaternal government to spend the next nine months in attempting to\\nimprove it.\\n\\n\\n\\nI had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as\\nair—or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will\\npermit a man to be.\\n\\nUnder such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to\\nLondon, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of\\nthe Empire are irresistibly drained.\\n\\nThere I stayed for some time at a\\nprivate hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless\\nexistence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely\\nthan I ought.'\n",
      "'There I stayed for some time at a\\nprivate hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless\\nexistence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely\\nthan I ought.\\n\\nSo alarming did the state of my finances become, that I\\nsoon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate\\nsomewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in\\nmy style of living.\\n\\nChoosing the latter alternative, I began by making\\nup my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less\\npretentious and less expensive domicile.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at\\nthe Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning\\nround I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at\\nBarts.\\n\\nThe sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London\\nis a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man.'\n",
      "'The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London\\nis a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man.\\n\\nIn old days Stamford had\\nnever been a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with\\nenthusiasm, and he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me.\\n\\nIn\\nthe exuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn,\\nand we started off together in a hansom.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?”\\n\\nhe asked in\\nundisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets.\\n\\n\\n“You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded it\\nby the time that we reached our destination.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Poor devil!”\\n\\nhe said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my\\nmisfortunes.\\n\\n“What are you up to now?”\\n\\n“Looking for lodgings,” I answered.'\n",
      "'“Poor devil!”\\n\\nhe said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my\\nmisfortunes.\\n\\n“What are you up to now?”\\n\\n“Looking for lodgings,” I answered.\\n\\n“Trying to solve the problem as to\\nwhether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable price.”\\n\\n“That’s a strange thing,” remarked my companion; “you are the second\\nman to-day that has used that expression to me.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“And who was the first?”\\n\\nI asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n“A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital.\\n\\n\\nHe was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone\\nto go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found, and which\\nwere too much for his purse.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“By Jove!”\\n\\nI cried, “if he really wants someone to share the rooms and\\nthe expense, I am the very man for him.\\n\\nI should prefer having a\\npartner to being alone.”\\n\\n\\n\\nYoung Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass.'\n",
      "'I should prefer having a\\npartner to being alone.”\\n\\n\\n\\nYoung Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass.\\n\\n“You\\ndon’t know Sherlock Holmes yet,” he said; “perhaps you would not care\\nfor him as a constant companion.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Why, what is there against him?”\\n\\n“Oh, I didn’t say there was anything against him.\\n\\nHe is a little queer\\nin his ideas—an enthusiast in some branches of science.\\n\\nAs far as I\\nknow he is a decent fellow enough.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“A medical student, I suppose?” said I.\\n\\n“No—I have no idea what he intends to go in for.\\n\\nI believe he is well\\nup in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I know,\\nhe has never taken out any systematic medical classes.\\n\\nHis studies are\\nvery desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the\\nway knowledge which would astonish his professors.”\\n\\n“Did you never ask him what he was going in for?”\\n\\nI asked.'\n",
      "'His studies are\\nvery desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the\\nway knowledge which would astonish his professors.”\\n\\n“Did you never ask him what he was going in for?”\\n\\nI asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n“No; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be\\ncommunicative enough when the fancy seizes him.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I should like to meet him,” I said.\\n\\n“If I am to lodge with anyone, I\\nshould prefer a man of studious and quiet habits.\\n\\nI am not strong\\nenough yet to stand much noise or excitement.\\n\\nI had enough of both in\\nAfghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence.\\n\\nHow\\ncould I meet this friend of yours?”\\n\\n“He is sure to be at the laboratory,” returned my companion.\\n\\n“He either\\navoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from morning to\\nnight.\\n\\nIf you like, we shall drive round together after luncheon.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Certainly,” I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other\\nchannels.'\n",
      "'If you like, we shall drive round together after luncheon.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Certainly,” I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other\\nchannels.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn, Stamford\\ngave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to\\ntake as a fellow-lodger.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You mustn’t blame me if you don’t get on with him,” he said; “I know\\nnothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally\\nin the laboratory.\\n\\nYou proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold\\nme responsible.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“If we don’t get on it will be easy to part company,” I answered.\\n\\n“It\\nseems to me, Stamford,” I added, looking hard at my companion, “that\\nyou have some reason for washing your hands of the matter.\\n\\nIs this\\nfellow’s temper so formidable, or what is it?\\n\\nDon’t be mealy-mouthed\\nabout it.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“It is not easy to express the inexpressible,” he answered with a\\nlaugh.\\n\\n“Holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes—it approaches\\nto cold-bloodedness.'\n",

      "'PART I.\\n\\n\\n(_Being a reprint from the Reminiscences of_ JOHN H. WATSON, M.D.,\\n_Late of the Army Medical Department._)'\n",
      "'CHAPTER I.\\nMR. SHERLOCK HOLMES.\\n\\n\\nIn the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the\\nUniversity of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course\\nprescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there,\\nI was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant\\nSurgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before I\\ncould join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at\\nBombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and\\nwas already deep in the enemy’s country. I followed, however, with many\\nother officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded\\nin reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once\\nentered upon my new duties.\\n\\nThe campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had\\nnothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and\\nattached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of\\nMaiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which\\nshattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should have\\nfallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the\\ndevotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a\\npack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.\\n\\nWorn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had\\nundergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to\\nthe base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improved\\nso far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little\\nupon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse\\nof our Indian possessions. For months my life was despaired of, and\\nwhen at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak\\nand emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be\\nlost in sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in\\nthe troopship “Orontes,” and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty,\\nwith my health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a\\npaternal government to spend the next nine months in attempting to\\nimprove it.\\n\\nI had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as\\nair—or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will\\npermit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to\\nLondon, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of\\nthe Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time at a\\nprivate hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless\\nexistence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely\\nthan I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances become, that I\\nsoon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate\\nsomewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in\\nmy style of living. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making\\nup my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less\\npretentious and less expensive domicile.\\n\\nOn the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at\\nthe Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning\\nround I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at\\nBarts. The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London\\nis a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In old days Stamford had\\nnever been a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with\\nenthusiasm, and he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me. In\\nthe exuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn,\\nand we started off together in a hansom.\\n\\n“Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?” he asked in\\nundisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets.\\n“You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.”\\n\\nI gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded it\\nby the time that we reached our destination.\\n\\n“Poor devil!” he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my\\nmisfortunes. “What are you up to now?”\\n\\n“Looking for lodgings,” I answered. “Trying to solve the problem as to\\nwhether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable price.”\\n\\n“That’s a strange thing,” remarked my companion; “you are the second\\nman to-day that has used that expression to me.”\\n\\n“And who was the first?” I asked.\\n\\n“A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital.\\nHe was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone\\nto go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found, and which\\nwere too much for his purse.”\\n\\n“By Jove!” I cried, “if he really wants someone to share the rooms and\\nthe expense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a\\npartner to being alone.”\\n\\nYoung Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass. “You\\ndon’t know Sherlock Holmes yet,” he said; “perhaps you would not care\\nfor him as a constant companion.”\\n\\n“Why, what is there against him?”\\n\\n“Oh, I didn’t say there was anything against him. He is a little queer\\nin his ideas—an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as I\\nknow he is a decent fellow enough.”\\n\\n“A medical student, I suppose?” said I.\\n\\n“No—I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is well\\nup in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I know,\\nhe has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His studies are\\nvery desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the\\nway knowledge which would astonish his professors.”\\n\\n“Did you never ask him what he was going in for?” I asked.\\n\\n“No; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be\\ncommunicative enough when the fancy seizes him.”\\n\\n“I should like to meet him,” I said. “If I am to lodge with anyone, I\\nshould prefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strong\\nenough yet to stand much noise or excitement. I had enough of both in\\nAfghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence. How\\ncould I meet this friend of yours?”\\n\\n“He is sure to be at the laboratory,” returned my companion. “He either\\navoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from morning to\\nnight. If you like, we shall drive round together after luncheon.”\\n\\n“Certainly,” I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other\\nchannels.\\n\\nAs we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn, Stamford\\ngave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to\\ntake as a fellow-lodger.\\n\\n“You mustn’t blame me if you don’t get on with him,” he said; “I know\\nnothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally\\nin the laboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold\\nme responsible.”\\n\\n“If we don’t get on it will be easy to part company,” I answered. “It\\nseems to me, Stamford,” I added, looking hard at my companion, “that\\nyou have some reason for washing your hands of the matter. Is this\\nfellow’s temper so formidable, or what is it? Don’t be mealy-mouthed\\nabout it.”\\n\\n“It is not easy to express the inexpressible,” he answered with a\\nlaugh. “Holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes—it approaches\\nto cold-bloodedness. I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch\\nof the latest vegetable alkaloid, not out of malevolence, you\\nunderstand, but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an\\naccurate idea of the effects. To do him justice, I think that he would\\ntake it himself with the same readiness. He appears to have a passion\\nfor definite and exact knowledge.”\\n\\n“Very right too.”\\n\\n“Yes, but it may be pushed to excess. When it comes to beating the\\nsubjects in the dissecting-rooms with a stick, it is certainly taking\\nrather a bizarre shape.”\\n\\n“Beating the subjects!”\\n\\n“Yes, to verify how far bruises may be produced after death. I saw him\\nat it with my own eyes.”\\n\\n“And yet you say he is not a medical student?”\\n\\n“No. Heaven knows what the objects of his studies are. But here we are,\\nand you must form your own impressions about him.” As he spoke, we\\nturned down a narrow lane and passed through a small side-door, which\\nopened into a wing of the great hospital. It was familiar ground to me,\\nand I needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone staircase and\\nmade our way down the long corridor with its vista of whitewashed wall\\nand dun-coloured doors. Near the further end a low arched passage\\nbranched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory.\\n\\nThis was a lofty chamber, lined and littered with countless bottles.\\nBroad, low tables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts,\\ntest-tubes, and little Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering flames.\\nThere was only one student in the room, who was bending over a distant\\ntable absorbed in his work. At the sound of our steps he glanced round\\nand sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure. “I’ve found it! I’ve\\nfound it,” he shouted to my companion, running towards us with a\\ntest-tube in his hand. “I have found a re-agent which is precipitated\\nby hæmoglobin, and by nothing else.” Had he discovered a gold mine,\\ngreater delight could not have shone upon his features.\\n\\n“Dr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” said Stamford, introducing us.\\n\\n“How are you?” he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength for\\nwhich I should hardly have given him credit. “You have been in\\nAfghanistan, I perceive.”\\n\\n“How on earth did you know that?” I asked in astonishment.\\n\\n“Never mind,” said he, chuckling to himself. “The question now is about\\nhæmoglobin. No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of\\nmine?”\\n\\n“It is interesting, chemically, no doubt,” I answered, “but\\npractically——”\\n\\n“Why, man, it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years.\\nDon’t you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains.\\nCome over here now!” He seized me by the coat-sleeve in his eagerness,\\nand drew me over to the table at which he had been working. “Let us\\nhave some fresh blood,” he said, digging a long bodkin into his finger,\\nand drawing off the resulting drop of blood in a chemical pipette.\\n“Now, I add this small quantity of blood to a litre of water. You\\nperceive that the resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water.\\nThe proportion of blood cannot be more than one in a million. I have no\\ndoubt, however, that we shall be able to obtain the characteristic\\nreaction.” As he spoke, he threw into the vessel a few white crystals,\\nand then added some drops of a transparent fluid. In an instant the\\ncontents assumed a dull mahogany colour, and a brownish dust was\\nprecipitated to the bottom of the glass jar.\\n\\n“Ha! ha!” he cried, clapping his hands, and looking as delighted as a\\nchild with a new toy. “What do you think of that?”\\n\\n“It seems to be a very delicate test,” I remarked.\\n\\n“Beautiful! beautiful! The old Guiacum test was very clumsy and\\nuncertain. So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles. The\\nlatter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old. Now, this\\nappears to act as well whether the blood is old or new. Had this test\\nbeen invented, there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who\\nwould long ago have paid the penalty of their crimes.”\\n\\n“Indeed!” I murmured.\\n\\n“Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. A man is\\nsuspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed. His\\nlinen or clothes are examined, and brownish stains discovered upon\\nthem. Are they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit\\nstains, or what are they? That is a question which has puzzled many an\\nexpert, and why? Because there was no reliable test. Now we have the\\nSherlock Holmes’ test, and there will no longer be any difficulty.”\\n\\nHis eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his\\nheart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his\\nimagination.\\n\\n“You are to be congratulated,” I remarked, considerably surprised at\\nhis enthusiasm.\\n\\n“There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year. He would\\ncertainly have been hung had this test been in existence. Then there\\nwas Mason of Bradford, and the notorious Muller, and Lefevre of\\nMontpellier, and Samson of New Orleans. I could name a score of cases\\nin which it would have been decisive.”\\n\\n“You seem to be a walking calendar of crime,” said Stamford with a\\nlaugh. “You might start a paper on those lines. Call it the ‘Police\\nNews of the Past.’”\\n\\n“Very interesting reading it might be made, too,” remarked Sherlock\\nHolmes, sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger.\\n“I have to be careful,” he continued, turning to me with a smile, “for\\nI dabble with poisons a good deal.” He held out his hand as he spoke,\\nand I noticed that it was all mottled over with similar pieces of\\nplaster, and discoloured with strong acids.\\n\\n“We came here on business,” said Stamford, sitting down on a high\\nthree-legged stool, and pushing another one in my direction with his\\nfoot. “My friend here wants to take diggings, and as you were\\ncomplaining that you could get no one to go halves with you, I thought\\nthat I had better bring you together.”\\n\\nSherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms with\\nme. “I have my eye on a suite in Baker Street,” he said, “which would\\nsuit us down to the ground. You don’t mind the smell of strong tobacco,\\nI hope?”\\n\\n“I always smoke ‘ship’s’ myself,” I answered.\\n\\n“That’s good enough. I generally have chemicals about, and occasionally\\ndo experiments. Would that annoy you?”\\n\\n“By no means.”\\n\\n“Let me see—what are my other shortcomings. I get in the dumps at\\ntimes, and don’t open my mouth for days on end. You must not think I am\\nsulky when I do that. Just let me alone, and I’ll soon be right. What\\nhave you to confess now? It’s just as well for two fellows to know the\\nworst of one another before they begin to live together.”\\n\\nI laughed at this cross-examination. “I keep a bull pup,” I said, “and\\nI object to rows because my nerves are shaken, and I get up at all\\nsorts of ungodly hours, and I am extremely lazy. I have another set of\\nvices when I’m well, but those are the principal ones at present.”\\n\\n“Do you include violin-playing in your category of rows?” he asked,\\nanxiously.\\n\\n“It depends on the player,” I answered. “A well-played violin is a\\ntreat for the gods—a badly-played one——”\\n\\n“Oh, that’s all right,” he cried, with a merry laugh. “I think we may\\nconsider the thing as settled—that is, if the rooms are agreeable to\\nyou.”\\n\\n“When shall we see them?”\\n\\n“Call for me here at noon to-morrow, and we’ll go together and settle\\neverything,” he answered.\\n\\n“All right—noon exactly,” said I, shaking his hand.\\n\\nWe left him working among his chemicals, and we walked together towards\\nmy hotel.\\n\\n“By the way,” I asked suddenly, stopping and turning upon Stamford,\\n“how the deuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan?”\\n\\nMy companion smiled an enigmatical smile. “That’s just his little\\npeculiarity,” he said. “A good many people have wanted to know how he\\nfinds things out.”\\n\\n“Oh! a mystery is it?” I cried, rubbing my hands. “This is very\\npiquant. I am much obliged to you for bringing us together. ‘The proper\\nstudy of mankind is man,’ you know.”\\n\\n“You must study him, then,” Stamford said, as he bade me good-bye.\\n“You’ll find him a knotty problem, though. I’ll wager he learns more\\nabout you than you about him. Good-bye.”\\n\\n“Good-bye,” I answered, and strolled on to my hotel, considerably\\ninterested in my new acquaintance.'\n",
      "'CHAPTER II.\\nTHE SCIENCE OF DEDUCTION.\\n\\n\\nWe met next day as he had arranged, and inspected the rooms at No.\\n221B, Baker Street, of which he had spoken at our meeting. They\\nconsisted of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single large airy\\nsitting-room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad\\nwindows. So desirable in every way were the apartments, and so moderate\\ndid the terms seem when divided between us, that the bargain was\\nconcluded upon the spot, and we at once entered into possession. That\\nvery evening I moved my things round from the hotel, and on the\\nfollowing morning Sherlock Holmes followed me with several boxes and\\nportmanteaus. For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and\\nlaying out our property to the best advantage. That done, we gradually\\nbegan to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new\\nsurroundings.\\n\\nHolmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet in\\nhis ways, and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to be up\\nafter ten at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out\\nbefore I rose in the morning. Sometimes he spent his day at the\\nchemical laboratory, sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and\\noccasionally in long walks, which appeared to take him into the lowest\\nportions of the City. Nothing could exceed his energy when the working\\nfit was upon him; but now and again a reaction would seize him, and for\\ndays on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, hardly\\nuttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night. On these\\noccasions I have noticed such a dreamy, vacant expression in his eyes,\\nthat I might have suspected him of being addicted to the use of some\\nnarcotic, had not the temperance and cleanliness of his whole life\\nforbidden such a notion.\\n\\nAs the weeks went by, my interest in him and my curiosity as to his\\naims in life, gradually deepened and increased. His very person and\\nappearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual\\nobserver. In height he was rather over six feet, and so excessively\\nlean that he seemed to be considerably taller. His eyes were sharp and\\npiercing, save during those intervals of torpor to which I have\\nalluded; and his thin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an air\\nof alertness and decision. His chin, too, had the prominence and\\nsquareness which mark the man of determination. His hands were\\ninvariably blotted with ink and stained with chemicals, yet he was\\npossessed of extraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had\\noccasion to observe when I watched him manipulating his fragile\\nphilosophical instruments.\\n\\nThe reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody, when I confess how\\nmuch this man stimulated my curiosity, and how often I endeavoured to\\nbreak through the reticence which he showed on all that concerned\\nhimself. Before pronouncing judgment, however, be it remembered, how\\nobjectless was my life, and how little there was to engage my\\nattention. My health forbade me from venturing out unless the weather\\nwas exceptionally genial, and I had no friends who would call upon me\\nand break the monotony of my daily existence. Under these\\ncircumstances, I eagerly hailed the little mystery which hung around my\\ncompanion, and spent much of my time in endeavouring to unravel it.\\n\\nHe was not studying medicine. He had himself, in reply to a question,\\nconfirmed Stamford’s opinion upon that point. Neither did he appear to\\nhave pursued any course of reading which might fit him for a degree in\\nscience or any other recognized portal which would give him an entrance\\ninto the learned world. Yet his zeal for certain studies was\\nremarkable, and within eccentric limits his knowledge was so\\nextraordinarily ample and minute that his observations have fairly\\nastounded me. Surely no man would work so hard or attain such precise\\ninformation unless he had some definite end in view. Desultory readers\\nare seldom remarkable for the exactness of their learning. No man\\nburdens his mind with small matters unless he has some very good reason\\nfor doing so.\\n\\nHis ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge. Of contemporary\\nliterature, philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to\\nnothing. Upon my quoting Thomas Carlyle, he inquired in the naivest way\\nwho he might be and what he had done. My surprise reached a climax,\\nhowever, when I found incidentally that he was ignorant of the\\nCopernican Theory and of the composition of the Solar System. That any\\ncivilized human being in this nineteenth century should not be aware\\nthat the earth travelled round the sun appeared to be to me such an\\nextraordinary fact that I could hardly realize it.\\n\\n“You appear to be astonished,” he said, smiling at my expression of\\nsurprise. “Now that I do know it I shall do my best to forget it.”\\n\\n“To forget it!”\\n\\n“You see,” he explained, “I consider that a man’s brain originally is\\nlike a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture\\nas you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he\\ncomes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets\\ncrowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so\\nthat he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skilful\\nworkman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his\\nbrain-attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in\\ndoing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the\\nmost perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has\\nelastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes\\na time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that\\nyou knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to\\nhave useless facts elbowing out the useful ones.”\\n\\n“But the Solar System!” I protested.\\n\\n“What the deuce is it to me?” he interrupted impatiently; “you say that\\nwe go round the sun. If we went round the moon it would not make a\\npennyworth of difference to me or to my work.”\\n\\nI was on the point of asking him what that work might be, but something\\nin his manner showed me that the question would be an unwelcome one. I\\npondered over our short conversation, however, and endeavoured to draw\\nmy deductions from it. He said that he would acquire no knowledge which\\ndid not bear upon his object. Therefore all the knowledge which he\\npossessed was such as would be useful to him. I enumerated in my own\\nmind all the various points upon which he had shown me that he was\\nexceptionally well-informed. I even took a pencil and jotted them down.\\nI could not help smiling at the document when I had completed it. It\\nran in this way—\\n\\n\\nSHERLOCK HOLMES—his limits.\\n\\n\\n1. Knowledge of Literature.—Nil.\\n2. Philosophy.—Nil.\\n3. Astronomy.—Nil.\\n4. Politics.—Feeble.\\n5. Botany.—Variable. Well up in belladonna, opium, and poisons\\ngenerally. Knows nothing of practical gardening.\\n6. Geology.—Practical, but limited. Tells at a glance different soils\\nfrom each other. After walks has shown me splashes upon his trousers,\\nand told me by their colour and consistence in what part of London he\\nhad received them.\\n7. Chemistry.—Profound.\\n8. Anatomy.—Accurate, but unsystematic.\\n9. Sensational Literature.—Immense. He appears to know every detail of\\nevery horror perpetrated in the century.\\n10. Plays the violin well.\\n11. Is an expert singlestick player, boxer, and swordsman.\\n12. Has a good practical knowledge of British law.\\n\\n\\nWhen I had got so far in my list I threw it into the fire in despair.\\n“If I can only find what the fellow is driving at by reconciling all\\nthese accomplishments, and discovering a calling which needs them all,”\\nI said to myself, “I may as well give up the attempt at once.”\\n\\nI see that I have alluded above to his powers upon the violin. These\\nwere very remarkable, but as eccentric as all his other\\naccomplishments. That he could play pieces, and difficult pieces, I\\nknew well, because at my request he has played me some of Mendelssohn’s\\nLieder, and other favourites. When left to himself, however, he would\\nseldom produce any music or attempt any recognized air. Leaning back in\\nhis arm-chair of an evening, he would close his eyes and scrape\\ncarelessly at the fiddle which was thrown across his knee. Sometimes\\nthe chords were sonorous and melancholy. Occasionally they were\\nfantastic and cheerful. Clearly they reflected the thoughts which\\npossessed him, but whether the music aided those thoughts, or whether\\nthe playing was simply the result of a whim or fancy was more than I\\ncould determine. I might have rebelled against these exasperating solos\\nhad it not been that he usually terminated them by playing in quick\\nsuccession a whole series of my favourite airs as a slight compensation\\nfor the trial upon my patience.\\n\\nDuring the first week or so we had no callers, and I had begun to think\\nthat my companion was as friendless a man as I was myself. Presently,\\nhowever, I found that he had many acquaintances, and those in the most\\ndifferent classes of society. There was one little sallow rat-faced,\\ndark-eyed fellow who was introduced to me as Mr. Lestrade, and who came\\nthree or four times in a single week. One morning a young girl called,\\nfashionably dressed, and stayed for half an hour or more. The same\\nafternoon brought a grey-headed, seedy visitor, looking like a Jew\\npedlar, who appeared to me to be much excited, and who was closely\\nfollowed by a slip-shod elderly woman. On another occasion an old\\nwhite-haired gentleman had an interview with my companion; and on\\nanother a railway porter in his velveteen uniform. When any of these\\nnondescript individuals put in an appearance, Sherlock Holmes used to\\nbeg for the use of the sitting-room, and I would retire to my bed-room.\\nHe always apologized to me for putting me to this inconvenience. “I\\nhave to use this room as a place of business,” he said, “and these\\npeople are my clients.” Again I had an opportunity of asking him a\\npoint blank question, and again my delicacy prevented me from forcing\\nanother man to confide in me. I imagined at the time that he had some\\nstrong reason for not alluding to it, but he soon dispelled the idea by\\ncoming round to the subject of his own accord.\\n\\nIt was upon the 4th of March, as I have good reason to remember, that I\\nrose somewhat earlier than usual, and found that Sherlock Holmes had\\nnot yet finished his breakfast. The landlady had become so accustomed\\nto my late habits that my place had not been laid nor my coffee\\nprepared. With the unreasonable petulance of mankind I rang the bell\\nand gave a curt intimation that I was ready. Then I picked up a\\nmagazine from the table and attempted to while away the time with it,\\nwhile my companion munched silently at his toast. One of the articles\\nhad a pencil mark at the heading, and I naturally began to run my eye\\nthrough it.\\n\\nIts somewhat ambitious title was “The Book of Life,” and it attempted\\nto show how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and\\nsystematic examination of all that came in his way. It struck me as\\nbeing a remarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity. The\\nreasoning was close and intense, but the deductions appeared to me to\\nbe far-fetched and exaggerated. The writer claimed by a momentary\\nexpression, a twitch of a muscle or a glance of an eye, to fathom a\\nman’s inmost thoughts. Deceit, according to him, was an impossibility\\nin the case of one trained to observation and analysis. His conclusions\\nwere as infallible as so many propositions of Euclid. So startling\\nwould his results appear to the uninitiated that until they learned the\\nprocesses by which he had arrived at them they might well consider him\\nas a necromancer.\\n\\n“From a drop of water,” said the writer, “a logician could infer the\\npossibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of\\none or the other. So all life is a great chain, the nature of which is\\nknown whenever we are shown a single link of it. Like all other arts,\\nthe Science of Deduction and Analysis is one which can only be acquired\\nby long and patient study nor, is life long enough to allow any mortal\\nto attain the highest possible perfection in it. Before turning to\\nthose moral and mental aspects of the matter which present the greatest\\ndifficulties, let the enquirer begin by mastering more elementary\\nproblems. Let him, on meeting a fellow-mortal, learn at a glance to\\ndistinguish the history of the man, and the trade or profession to\\nwhich he belongs. Puerile as such an exercise may seem, it sharpens the\\nfaculties of observation, and teaches one where to look and what to\\nlook for. By a man’s finger nails, by his coat-sleeve, by his boot, by\\nhis trouser knees, by the callosities of his forefinger and thumb, by\\nhis expression, by his shirt cuffs—by each of these things a man’s\\ncalling is plainly revealed. That all united should fail to enlighten\\nthe competent enquirer in any case is almost inconceivable.”\\n\\n“What ineffable twaddle!” I cried, slapping the magazine down on the\\ntable, “I never read such rubbish in my life.”\\n\\n“What is it?” asked Sherlock Holmes.\\n\\n“Why, this article,” I said, pointing at it with my egg spoon as I sat\\ndown to my breakfast. “I see that you have read it since you have\\nmarked it. I don’t deny that it is smartly written. It irritates me\\nthough. It is evidently the theory of some arm-chair lounger who\\nevolves all these neat little paradoxes in the seclusion of his own\\nstudy. It is not practical. I should like to see him clapped down in a\\nthird class carriage on the Underground, and asked to give the trades\\nof all his fellow-travellers. I would lay a thousand to one against\\nhim.”\\n\\n“You would lose your money,” Sherlock Holmes remarked calmly. “As for\\nthe article I wrote it myself.”\\n\\n“You!”\\n\\n“Yes, I have a turn both for observation and for deduction. The\\ntheories which I have expressed there, and which appear to you to be so\\nchimerical are really extremely practical—so practical that I depend\\nupon them for my bread and cheese.”\\n\\n“And how?” I asked involuntarily.\\n\\n“Well, I have a trade of my own. I suppose I am the only one in the\\nworld. I’m a consulting detective, if you can understand what that is.\\nHere in London we have lots of Government detectives and lots of\\nprivate ones. When these fellows are at fault they come to me, and I\\nmanage to put them on the right scent. They lay all the evidence before\\nme, and I am generally able, by the help of my knowledge of the history\\nof crime, to set them straight. There is a strong family resemblance\\nabout misdeeds, and if you have all the details of a thousand at your\\nfinger ends, it is odd if you can’t unravel the thousand and first.\\nLestrade is a well-known detective. He got himself into a fog recently\\nover a forgery case, and that was what brought him here.”\\n\\n“And these other people?”\\n\\n“They are mostly sent on by private inquiry agencies. They are all\\npeople who are in trouble about something, and want a little\\nenlightening. I listen to their story, they listen to my comments, and\\nthen I pocket my fee.”\\n\\n“But do you mean to say,” I said, “that without leaving your room you\\ncan unravel some knot which other men can make nothing of, although\\nthey have seen every detail for themselves?”\\n\\n“Quite so. I have a kind of intuition that way. Now and again a case\\nturns up which is a little more complex. Then I have to bustle about\\nand see things with my own eyes. You see I have a lot of special\\nknowledge which I apply to the problem, and which facilitates matters\\nwonderfully. Those rules of deduction laid down in that article which\\naroused your scorn, are invaluable to me in practical work. Observation\\nwith me is second nature. You appeared to be surprised when I told you,\\non our first meeting, that you had come from Afghanistan.”\\n\\n“You were told, no doubt.”\\n\\n“Nothing of the sort. I _knew_ you came from Afghanistan. From long\\nhabit the train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my mind, that I\\narrived at the conclusion without being conscious of intermediate\\nsteps. There were such steps, however. The train of reasoning ran,\\n‘Here is a gentleman of a medical type, but with the air of a military\\nman. Clearly an army doctor, then. He has just come from the tropics,\\nfor his face is dark, and that is not the natural tint of his skin, for\\nhis wrists are fair. He has undergone hardship and sickness, as his\\nhaggard face says clearly. His left arm has been injured. He holds it\\nin a stiff and unnatural manner. Where in the tropics could an English\\narmy doctor have seen much hardship and got his arm wounded? Clearly in\\nAfghanistan.’ The whole train of thought did not occupy a second. I\\nthen remarked that you came from Afghanistan, and you were astonished.”\\n\\n“It is simple enough as you explain it,” I said, smiling. “You remind\\nme of Edgar Allen Poe’s Dupin. I had no idea that such individuals did\\nexist outside of stories.”\\n\\nSherlock Holmes rose and lit his pipe. “No doubt you think that you are\\ncomplimenting me in comparing me to Dupin,” he observed. “Now, in my\\nopinion, Dupin was a very inferior fellow. That trick of his of\\nbreaking in on his friends’ thoughts with an apropos remark after a\\nquarter of an hour’s silence is really very showy and superficial. He\\nhad some analytical genius, no doubt; but he was by no means such a\\nphenomenon as Poe appeared to imagine.”\\n\\n“Have you read Gaboriau’s works?” I asked. “Does Lecoq come up to your\\nidea of a detective?”\\n\\nSherlock Holmes sniffed sardonically. “Lecoq was a miserable bungler,”\\nhe said, in an angry voice; “he had only one thing to recommend him,\\nand that was his energy. That book made me positively ill. The question\\nwas how to identify an unknown prisoner. I could have done it in\\ntwenty-four hours. Lecoq took six months or so. It might be made a\\ntext-book for detectives to teach them what to avoid.”\\n\\nI felt rather indignant at having two characters whom I had admired\\ntreated in this cavalier style. I walked over to the window, and stood\\nlooking out into the busy street. “This fellow may be very clever,” I\\nsaid to myself, “but he is certainly very conceited.”\\n\\n“There are no crimes and no criminals in these days,” he said,\\nquerulously. “What is the use of having brains in our profession. I\\nknow well that I have it in me to make my name famous. No man lives or\\nhas ever lived who has brought the same amount of study and of natural\\ntalent to the detection of crime which I have done. And what is the\\nresult? There is no crime to detect, or, at most, some bungling\\nvillainy with a motive so transparent that even a Scotland Yard\\nofficial can see through it.”\\n\\nI was still annoyed at his bumptious style of conversation. I thought\\nit best to change the topic.\\n\\n“I wonder what that fellow is looking for?” I asked, pointing to a\\nstalwart, plainly-dressed individual who was walking slowly down the\\nother side of the street, looking anxiously at the numbers. He had a\\nlarge blue envelope in his hand, and was evidently the bearer of a\\nmessage.\\n\\n“You mean the retired sergeant of Marines,” said Sherlock Holmes.\\n\\n“Brag and bounce!” thought I to myself. “He knows that I cannot verify\\nhis guess.”\\n\\nThe thought had hardly passed through my mind when the man whom we were\\nwatching caught sight of the number on our door, and ran rapidly across\\nthe roadway. We heard a loud knock, a deep voice below, and heavy steps\\nascending the stair.\\n\\n“For Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” he said, stepping into the room and handing\\nmy friend the letter.\\n\\nHere was an opportunity of taking the conceit out of him. He little\\nthought of this when he made that random shot. “May I ask, my lad,” I\\nsaid, in the blandest voice, “what your trade may be?”\\n\\n“Commissionaire, sir,” he said, gruffly. “Uniform away for repairs.”\\n\\n“And you were?” I asked, with a slightly malicious glance at my\\ncompanion.\\n\\n“A sergeant, sir, Royal Marine Light Infantry, sir. No answer? Right,\\nsir.”\\n\\nHe clicked his heels together, raised his hand in a salute, and was\\ngone.'\n",
      "'CHAPTER III.\\nTHE LAURISTON GARDENS MYSTERY\\n\\n\\nI confess that I was considerably startled by this fresh proof of the\\npractical nature of my companion’s theories. My respect for his powers\\nof analysis increased wondrously. There still remained some lurking\\nsuspicion in my mind, however, that the whole thing was a pre-arranged\\nepisode, intended to dazzle me, though what earthly object he could\\nhave in taking me in was past my comprehension. When I looked at him he\\nhad finished reading the note, and his eyes had assumed the vacant,\\nlack-lustre expression which showed mental abstraction.\\n\\n“How in the world did you deduce that?” I asked.\\n\\n“Deduce what?” said he, petulantly.\\n\\n“Why, that he was a retired sergeant of Marines.”\\n\\n“I have no time for trifles,” he answered, brusquely; then with a\\nsmile, “Excuse my rudeness. You broke the thread of my thoughts; but\\nperhaps it is as well. So you actually were not able to see that that\\nman was a sergeant of Marines?”\\n\\n“No, indeed.”\\n\\n“It was easier to know it than to explain why I knew it. If you were\\nasked to prove that two and two made four, you might find some\\ndifficulty, and yet you are quite sure of the fact. Even across the\\nstreet I could see a great blue anchor tattooed on the back of the\\nfellow’s hand. That smacked of the sea. He had a military carriage,\\nhowever, and regulation side whiskers. There we have the marine. He was\\na man with some amount of self-importance and a certain air of command.\\nYou must have observed the way in which he held his head and swung his\\ncane. A steady, respectable, middle-aged man, too, on the face of\\nhim—all facts which led me to believe that he had been a sergeant.”\\n\\n“Wonderful!” I ejaculated.\\n\\n“Commonplace,” said Holmes, though I thought from his expression that\\nhe was pleased at my evident surprise and admiration. “I said just now\\nthat there were no criminals. It appears that I am wrong—look at this!”\\nHe threw me over the note which the commissionaire had brought.\\n\\n“Why,” I cried, as I cast my eye over it, “this is terrible!”\\n\\n“It does seem to be a little out of the common,” he remarked, calmly.\\n“Would you mind reading it to me aloud?”\\n\\nThis is the letter which I read to him—\\n\\n“MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,—\\n\\n“There has been a bad business during the night at 3, Lauriston\\nGardens, off the Brixton Road. Our man on the beat saw a light there\\nabout two in the morning, and as the house was an empty one, suspected\\nthat something was amiss. He found the door open, and in the front\\nroom, which is bare of furniture, discovered the body of a gentleman,\\nwell dressed, and having cards in his pocket bearing the name of ‘Enoch\\nJ. Drebber, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.A.’ There had been no robbery, nor is\\nthere any evidence as to how the man met his death. There are marks of\\nblood in the room, but there is no wound upon his person. We are at a\\nloss as to how he came into the empty house; indeed, the whole affair\\nis a puzzler. If you can come round to the house any time before\\ntwelve, you will find me there. I have left everything _in statu quo_\\nuntil I hear from you. If you are unable to come I shall give you\\nfuller details, and would esteem it a great kindness if you would\\nfavour me with your opinion.\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\n“TOBIAS GREGSON.”\\n\\n“Gregson is the smartest of the Scotland Yarders,” my friend remarked;\\n“he and Lestrade are the pick of a bad lot. They are both quick and\\nenergetic, but conventional—shockingly so. They have their knives into\\none another, too. They are as jealous as a pair of professional\\nbeauties. There will be some fun over this case if they are both put\\nupon the scent.”\\n\\nI was amazed at the calm way in which he rippled on. “Surely there is\\nnot a moment to be lost,” I cried, “shall I go and order you a cab?”\\n\\n“I’m not sure about whether I shall go. I am the most incurably lazy\\ndevil that ever stood in shoe leather—that is, when the fit is on me,\\nfor I can be spry enough at times.”\\n\\n“Why, it is just such a chance as you have been longing for.”\\n\\n“My dear fellow, what does it matter to me. Supposing I unravel the\\nwhole matter, you may be sure that Gregson, Lestrade, and Co. will\\npocket all the credit. That comes of being an unofficial personage.”\\n\\n“But he begs you to help him.”\\n\\n“Yes. He knows that I am his superior, and acknowledges it to me; but\\nhe would cut his tongue out before he would own it to any third person.\\nHowever, we may as well go and have a look. I shall work it out on my\\nown hook. I may have a laugh at them if I have nothing else. Come on!”\\n\\nHe hustled on his overcoat, and bustled about in a way that showed that\\nan energetic fit had superseded the apathetic one.\\n\\n“Get your hat,” he said.\\n\\n“You wish me to come?”\\n\\n“Yes, if you have nothing better to do.” A minute later we were both in\\na hansom, driving furiously for the Brixton Road.\\n\\nIt was a foggy, cloudy morning, and a dun-coloured veil hung over the\\nhouse-tops, looking like the reflection of the mud-coloured streets\\nbeneath. My companion was in the best of spirits, and prattled away\\nabout Cremona fiddles, and the difference between a Stradivarius and an\\nAmati. As for myself, I was silent, for the dull weather and the\\nmelancholy business upon which we were engaged, depressed my spirits.\\n\\n“You don’t seem to give much thought to the matter in hand,” I said at\\nlast, interrupting Holmes’ musical disquisition.\\n\\n“No data yet,” he answered. “It is a capital mistake to theorize before\\nyou have all the evidence. It biases the judgment.”\\n\\n“You will have your data soon,” I remarked, pointing with my finger;\\n“this is the Brixton Road, and that is the house, if I am not very much\\nmistaken.”\\n\\n“So it is. Stop, driver, stop!” We were still a hundred yards or so\\nfrom it, but he insisted upon our alighting, and we finished our\\njourney upon foot.\\n\\nNumber 3, Lauriston Gardens wore an ill-omened and minatory look. It\\nwas one of four which stood back some little way from the street, two\\nbeing occupied and two empty. The latter looked out with three tiers of\\nvacant melancholy windows, which were blank and dreary, save that here\\nand there a “To Let” card had developed like a cataract upon the\\nbleared panes. A small garden sprinkled over with a scattered eruption\\nof sickly plants separated each of these houses from the street, and\\nwas traversed by a narrow pathway, yellowish in colour, and consisting\\napparently of a mixture of clay and of gravel. The whole place was very\\nsloppy from the rain which had fallen through the night. The garden was\\nbounded by a three-foot brick wall with a fringe of wood rails upon the\\ntop, and against this wall was leaning a stalwart police constable,\\nsurrounded by a small knot of loafers, who craned their necks and\\nstrained their eyes in the vain hope of catching some glimpse of the\\nproceedings within.\\n\\nI had imagined that Sherlock Holmes would at once have hurried into the\\nhouse and plunged into a study of the mystery. Nothing appeared to be\\nfurther from his intention. With an air of nonchalance which, under the\\ncircumstances, seemed to me to border upon affectation, he lounged up\\nand down the pavement, and gazed vacantly at the ground, the sky, the\\nopposite houses and the line of railings. Having finished his scrutiny,\\nhe proceeded slowly down the path, or rather down the fringe of grass\\nwhich flanked the path, keeping his eyes riveted upon the ground. Twice\\nhe stopped, and once I saw him smile, and heard him utter an\\nexclamation of satisfaction. There were many marks of footsteps upon\\nthe wet clayey soil, but since the police had been coming and going\\nover it, I was unable to see how my companion could hope to learn\\nanything from it. Still I had had such extraordinary evidence of the\\nquickness of his perceptive faculties, that I had no doubt that he\\ncould see a great deal which was hidden from me.\\n\\nAt the door of the house we were met by a tall, white-faced,\\nflaxen-haired man, with a notebook in his hand, who rushed forward and\\nwrung my companion’s hand with effusion. “It is indeed kind of you to\\ncome,” he said, “I have had everything left untouched.”\\n\\n“Except that!” my friend answered, pointing at the pathway. “If a herd\\nof buffaloes had passed along there could not be a greater mess. No\\ndoubt, however, you had drawn your own conclusions, Gregson, before you\\npermitted this.”\\n\\n“I have had so much to do inside the house,” the detective said\\nevasively. “My colleague, Mr. Lestrade, is here. I had relied upon him\\nto look after this.”\\n\\nHolmes glanced at me and raised his eyebrows sardonically. “With two\\nsuch men as yourself and Lestrade upon the ground, there will not be\\nmuch for a third party to find out,” he said.\\n\\nGregson rubbed his hands in a self-satisfied way. “I think we have done\\nall that can be done,” he answered; “it’s a queer case though, and I\\nknew your taste for such things.”\\n\\n“You did not come here in a cab?” asked Sherlock Holmes.\\n\\n“No, sir.”\\n\\n“Nor Lestrade?”\\n\\n“No, sir.”\\n\\n“Then let us go and look at the room.” With which inconsequent remark\\nhe strode on into the house, followed by Gregson, whose features\\nexpressed his astonishment.\\n\\nA short passage, bare planked and dusty, led to the kitchen and\\noffices. Two doors opened out of it to the left and to the right. One\\nof these had obviously been closed for many weeks. The other belonged\\nto the dining-room, which was the apartment in which the mysterious\\naffair had occurred. Holmes walked in, and I followed him with that\\nsubdued feeling at my heart which the presence of death inspires.\\n\\nIt was a large square room, looking all the larger from the absence of\\nall furniture. A vulgar flaring paper adorned the walls, but it was\\nblotched in places with mildew, and here and there great strips had\\nbecome detached and hung down, exposing the yellow plaster beneath.\\nOpposite the door was a showy fireplace, surmounted by a mantelpiece of\\nimitation white marble. On one corner of this was stuck the stump of a\\nred wax candle. The solitary window was so dirty that the light was\\nhazy and uncertain, giving a dull grey tinge to everything, which was\\nintensified by the thick layer of dust which coated the whole\\napartment.\\n\\nAll these details I observed afterwards. At present my attention was\\ncentred upon the single grim motionless figure which lay stretched upon\\nthe boards, with vacant sightless eyes staring up at the discoloured\\nceiling. It was that of a man about forty-three or forty-four years of\\nage, middle-sized, broad shouldered, with crisp curling black hair, and\\na short stubbly beard. He was dressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat\\nand waistcoat, with light-coloured trousers, and immaculate collar and\\ncuffs. A top hat, well brushed and trim, was placed upon the floor\\nbeside him. His hands were clenched and his arms thrown abroad, while\\nhis lower limbs were interlocked as though his death struggle had been\\na grievous one. On his rigid face there stood an expression of horror,\\nand as it seemed to me, of hatred, such as I have never seen upon human\\nfeatures. This malignant and terrible contortion, combined with the low\\nforehead, blunt nose, and prognathous jaw gave the dead man a\\nsingularly simious and ape-like appearance, which was increased by his\\nwrithing, unnatural posture. I have seen death in many forms, but never\\nhas it appeared to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark grimy\\napartment, which looked out upon one of the main arteries of suburban\\nLondon.\\n\\nLestrade, lean and ferret-like as ever, was standing by the doorway,\\nand greeted my companion and myself.\\n\\n“This case will make a stir, sir,” he remarked. “It beats anything I\\nhave seen, and I am no chicken.”\\n\\n“There is no clue?” said Gregson.\\n\\n“None at all,” chimed in Lestrade.\\n\\nSherlock Holmes approached the body, and, kneeling down, examined it\\nintently. “You are sure that there is no wound?” he asked, pointing to\\nnumerous gouts and splashes of blood which lay all round.\\n\\n“Positive!” cried both detectives.\\n\\n“Then, of course, this blood belongs to a second individual—presumably\\nthe murderer, if murder has been committed. It reminds me of the\\ncircumstances attendant on the death of Van Jansen, in Utrecht, in the\\nyear ‘34. Do you remember the case, Gregson?”\\n\\n“No, sir.”\\n\\n“Read it up—you really should. There is nothing new under the sun. It\\nhas all been done before.”\\n\\nAs he spoke, his nimble fingers were flying here, there, and\\neverywhere, feeling, pressing, unbuttoning, examining, while his eyes\\nwore the same far-away expression which I have already remarked upon.\\nSo swiftly was the examination made, that one would hardly have guessed\\nthe minuteness with which it was conducted. Finally, he sniffed the\\ndead man’s lips, and then glanced at the soles of his patent leather\\nboots.\\n\\n“He has not been moved at all?” he asked.\\n\\n“No more than was necessary for the purposes of our examination.”\\n\\n“You can take him to the mortuary now,” he said. “There is nothing more\\nto be learned.”\\n\\nGregson had a stretcher and four men at hand. At his call they entered\\nthe room, and the stranger was lifted and carried out. As they raised\\nhim, a ring tinkled down and rolled across the floor. Lestrade grabbed\\nit up and stared at it with mystified eyes.\\n\\n“There’s been a woman here,” he cried. “It’s a woman’s wedding-ring.”\\n\\nHe held it out, as he spoke, upon the palm of his hand. We all gathered\\nround him and gazed at it. There could be no doubt that that circlet of\\nplain gold had once adorned the finger of a bride.\\n\\n“This complicates matters,” said Gregson. “Heaven knows, they were\\ncomplicated enough before.”\\n\\n“You’re sure it doesn’t simplify them?” observed Holmes. “There’s\\nnothing to be learned by staring at it. What did you find in his\\npockets?”\\n\\n“We have it all here,” said Gregson, pointing to a litter of objects\\nupon one of the bottom steps of the stairs. “A gold watch, No. 97163,\\nby Barraud, of London. Gold Albert chain, very heavy and solid. Gold\\nring, with masonic device. Gold pin—bull-dog’s head, with rubies as\\neyes. Russian leather card-case, with cards of Enoch J. Drebber of\\nCleveland, corresponding with the E. J. D. upon the linen. No purse,\\nbut loose money to the extent of seven pounds thirteen. Pocket edition\\nof Boccaccio’s _Decameron_, with name of Joseph Stangerson upon the\\nfly-leaf. Two letters—one addressed to E. J. Drebber and one to Joseph\\nStangerson.”\\n\\n“At what address?”\\n\\n“American Exchange, Strand—to be left till called for. They are both\\nfrom the Guion Steamship Company, and refer to the sailing of their\\nboats from Liverpool. It is clear that this unfortunate man was about\\nto return to New York.”\\n\\n“Have you made any inquiries as to this man, Stangerson?”\\n\\n“I did it at once, sir,” said Gregson. “I have had advertisements sent\\nto all the newspapers, and one of my men has gone to the American\\nExchange, but he has not returned yet.”\\n\\n“Have you sent to Cleveland?”\\n\\n“We telegraphed this morning.”\\n\\n“How did you word your inquiries?”\\n\\n“We simply detailed the circumstances, and said that we should be glad\\nof any information which could help us.”\\n\\n“You did not ask for particulars on any point which appeared to you to\\nbe crucial?”\\n\\n“I asked about Stangerson.”\\n\\n“Nothing else? Is there no circumstance on which this whole case\\nappears to hinge? Will you not telegraph again?”\\n\\n“I have said all I have to say,” said Gregson, in an offended voice.\\n\\nSherlock Holmes chuckled to himself, and appeared to be about to make\\nsome remark, when Lestrade, who had been in the front room while we\\nwere holding this conversation in the hall, reappeared upon the scene,\\nrubbing his hands in a pompous and self-satisfied manner.\\n\\n“Mr. Gregson,” he said, “I have just made a discovery of the highest\\nimportance, and one which would have been overlooked had I not made a\\ncareful examination of the walls.”\\n\\nThe little man’s eyes sparkled as he spoke, and he was evidently in a\\nstate of suppressed exultation at having scored a point against his\\ncolleague.\\n\\n“Come here,” he said, bustling back into the room, the atmosphere of\\nwhich felt clearer since the removal of its ghastly inmate. “Now, stand\\nthere!”\\n\\nHe struck a match on his boot and held it up against the wall.\\n\\n“Look at that!” he said, triumphantly.\\n\\nI have remarked that the paper had fallen away in parts. In this\\nparticular corner of the room a large piece had peeled off, leaving a\\nyellow square of coarse plastering. Across this bare space there was\\nscrawled in blood-red letters a single word—\\n\\n\\nRACHE.\\n\\n\\n“What do you think of that?” cried the detective, with the air of a\\nshowman exhibiting his show. “This was overlooked because it was in the\\ndarkest corner of the room, and no one thought of looking there. The\\nmurderer has written it with his or her own blood. See this smear where\\nit has trickled down the wall! That disposes of the idea of suicide\\nanyhow. Why was that corner chosen to write it on? I will tell you. See\\nthat candle on the mantelpiece. It was lit at the time, and if it was\\nlit this corner would be the brightest instead of the darkest portion\\nof the wall.”\\n\\n“And what does it mean now that you _have_ found it?” asked Gregson in\\na depreciatory voice.\\n\\n“Mean? Why, it means that the writer was going to put the female name\\nRachel, but was disturbed before he or she had time to finish. You mark\\nmy words, when this case comes to be cleared up you will find that a\\nwoman named Rachel has something to do with it. It’s all very well for\\nyou to laugh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes. You may be very smart and clever,\\nbut the old hound is the best, when all is said and done.”\\n\\n“I really beg your pardon!” said my companion, who had ruffled the\\nlittle man’s temper by bursting into an explosion of laughter. “You\\ncertainly have the credit of being the first of us to find this out,\\nand, as you say, it bears every mark of having been written by the\\nother participant in last night’s mystery. I have not had time to\\nexamine this room yet, but with your permission I shall do so now.”\\n\\nAs he spoke, he whipped a tape measure and a large round magnifying\\nglass from his pocket. With these two implements he trotted noiselessly\\nabout the room, sometimes stopping, occasionally kneeling, and once\\nlying flat upon his face. So engrossed was he with his occupation that\\nhe appeared to have forgotten our presence, for he chattered away to\\nhimself under his breath the whole time, keeping up a running fire of\\nexclamations, groans, whistles, and little cries suggestive of\\nencouragement and of hope. As I watched him I was irresistibly reminded\\nof a pure-blooded well-trained foxhound as it dashes backwards and\\nforwards through the covert, whining in its eagerness, until it comes\\nacross the lost scent. For twenty minutes or more he continued his\\nresearches, measuring with the most exact care the distance between\\nmarks which were entirely invisible to me, and occasionally applying\\nhis tape to the walls in an equally incomprehensible manner. In one\\nplace he gathered up very carefully a little pile of grey dust from the\\nfloor, and packed it away in an envelope. Finally, he examined with his\\nglass the word upon the wall, going over every letter of it with the\\nmost minute exactness. This done, he appeared to be satisfied, for he\\nreplaced his tape and his glass in his pocket.\\n\\n“They say that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains,” he\\nremarked with a smile. “It’s a very bad definition, but it does apply\\nto detective work.”\\n\\nGregson and Lestrade had watched the manœuvres of their amateur\\ncompanion with considerable curiosity and some contempt. They evidently\\nfailed to appreciate the fact, which I had begun to realize, that\\nSherlock Holmes’ smallest actions were all directed towards some\\ndefinite and practical end.\\n\\n“What do you think of it, sir?” they both asked.\\n\\n“It would be robbing you of the credit of the case if I was to presume\\nto help you,” remarked my friend. “You are doing so well now that it\\nwould be a pity for anyone to interfere.” There was a world of sarcasm\\nin his voice as he spoke. “If you will let me know how your\\ninvestigations go,” he continued, “I shall be happy to give you any\\nhelp I can. In the meantime I should like to speak to the constable who\\nfound the body. Can you give me his name and address?”\\n\\nLestrade glanced at his note-book. “John Rance,” he said. “He is off\\nduty now. You will find him at 46, Audley Court, Kennington Park Gate.”\\n\\nHolmes took a note of the address.\\n\\n“Come along, Doctor,” he said; “we shall go and look him up. I’ll tell\\nyou one thing which may help you in the case,” he continued, turning to\\nthe two detectives. “There has been murder done, and the murderer was a\\nman. He was more than six feet high, was in the prime of life, had\\nsmall feet for his height, wore coarse, square-toed boots and smoked a\\nTrichinopoly cigar. He came here with his victim in a four-wheeled cab,\\nwhich was drawn by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on his\\noff fore leg. In all probability the murderer had a florid face, and\\nthe finger-nails of his right hand were remarkably long. These are only\\na few indications, but they may assist you.”\\n\\nLestrade and Gregson glanced at each other with an incredulous smile.\\n\\n“If this man was murdered, how was it done?” asked the former.\\n\\n“Poison,” said Sherlock Holmes curtly, and strode off. “One other\\nthing, Lestrade,” he added, turning round at the door: “‘Rache,’ is the\\nGerman for ‘revenge;’ so don’t lose your time looking for Miss Rachel.”\\n\\nWith which Parthian shot he walked away, leaving the two rivals\\nopen-mouthed behind him.'\n",
      "'CHAPTER IV.\\nWHAT JOHN RANCE HAD TO TELL.\\n\\n\\nIt was one o’clock when we left No. 3, Lauriston Gardens. Sherlock\\nHolmes led me to the nearest telegraph office, whence he dispatched a\\nlong telegram. He then hailed a cab, and ordered the driver to take us\\nto the address given us by Lestrade.\\n\\n“There is nothing like first hand evidence,” he remarked; “as a matter\\nof fact, my mind is entirely made up upon the case, but still we may as\\nwell learn all that is to be learned.”\\n\\n“You amaze me, Holmes,” said I. “Surely you are not as sure as you\\npretend to be of all those particulars which you gave.”\\n\\n“There’s no room for a mistake,” he answered. “The very first thing\\nwhich I observed on arriving there was that a cab had made two ruts\\nwith its wheels close to the curb. Now, up to last night, we have had\\nno rain for a week, so that those wheels which left such a deep\\nimpression must have been there during the night. There were the marks\\nof the horse’s hoofs, too, the outline of one of which was far more\\nclearly cut than that of the other three, showing that that was a new\\nshoe. Since the cab was there after the rain began, and was not there\\nat any time during the morning—I have Gregson’s word for that—it\\nfollows that it must have been there during the night, and, therefore,\\nthat it brought those two individuals to the house.”\\n\\n“That seems simple enough,” said I; “but how about the other man’s\\nheight?”\\n\\n“Why, the height of a man, in nine cases out of ten, can be told from\\nthe length of his stride. It is a simple calculation enough, though\\nthere is no use my boring you with figures. I had this fellow’s stride\\nboth on the clay outside and on the dust within. Then I had a way of\\nchecking my calculation. When a man writes on a wall, his instinct\\nleads him to write about the level of his own eyes. Now that writing\\nwas just over six feet from the ground. It was child’s play.”\\n\\n“And his age?” I asked.\\n\\n“Well, if a man can stride four and a-half feet without the smallest\\neffort, he can’t be quite in the sere and yellow. That was the breadth\\nof a puddle on the garden walk which he had evidently walked across.\\nPatent-leather boots had gone round, and Square-toes had hopped over.\\nThere is no mystery about it at all. I am simply applying to ordinary\\nlife a few of those precepts of observation and deduction which I\\nadvocated in that article. Is there anything else that puzzles you?”\\n\\n“The finger nails and the Trichinopoly,” I suggested.\\n\\n“The writing on the wall was done with a man’s forefinger dipped in\\nblood. My glass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly\\nscratched in doing it, which would not have been the case if the man’s\\nnail had been trimmed. I gathered up some scattered ash from the floor.\\nIt was dark in colour and flakey—such an ash as is only made by a\\nTrichinopoly. I have made a special study of cigar ashes—in fact, I\\nhave written a monograph upon the subject. I flatter myself that I can\\ndistinguish at a glance the ash of any known brand, either of cigar or\\nof tobacco. It is just in such details that the skilled detective\\ndiffers from the Gregson and Lestrade type.”\\n\\n“And the florid face?” I asked.\\n\\n“Ah, that was a more daring shot, though I have no doubt that I was\\nright. You must not ask me that at the present state of the affair.”\\n\\nI passed my hand over my brow. “My head is in a whirl,” I remarked;\\n“the more one thinks of it the more mysterious it grows. How came these\\ntwo men—if there were two men—into an empty house? What has become of\\nthe cabman who drove them? How could one man compel another to take\\npoison? Where did the blood come from? What was the object of the\\nmurderer, since robbery had no part in it? How came the woman’s ring\\nthere? Above all, why should the second man write up the German word\\nRACHE before decamping? I confess that I cannot see any possible way of\\nreconciling all these facts.”\\n\\nMy companion smiled approvingly.\\n\\n“You sum up the difficulties of the situation succinctly and well,” he\\nsaid. “There is much that is still obscure, though I have quite made up\\nmy mind on the main facts. As to poor Lestrade’s discovery it was\\nsimply a blind intended to put the police upon a wrong track, by\\nsuggesting Socialism and secret societies. It was not done by a German.\\nThe A, if you noticed, was printed somewhat after the German fashion.\\nNow, a real German invariably prints in the Latin character, so that we\\nmay safely say that this was not written by one, but by a clumsy\\nimitator who overdid his part. It was simply a ruse to divert inquiry\\ninto a wrong channel. I’m not going to tell you much more of the case,\\nDoctor. You know a conjuror gets no credit when once he has explained\\nhis trick, and if I show you too much of my method of working, you will\\ncome to the conclusion that I am a very ordinary individual after all.”\\n\\n“I shall never do that,” I answered; “you have brought detection as\\nnear an exact science as it ever will be brought in this world.”\\n\\nMy companion flushed up with pleasure at my words, and the earnest way\\nin which I uttered them. I had already observed that he was as\\nsensitive to flattery on the score of his art as any girl could be of\\nher beauty.\\n\\n“I’ll tell you one other thing,” he said. “Patent-leathers and\\nSquare-toes came in the same cab, and they walked down the pathway\\ntogether as friendly as possible—arm-in-arm, in all probability. When\\nthey got inside they walked up and down the room—or rather,\\nPatent-leathers stood still while Square-toes walked up and down. I\\ncould read all that in the dust; and I could read that as he walked he\\ngrew more and more excited. That is shown by the increased length of\\nhis strides. He was talking all the while, and working himself up, no\\ndoubt, into a fury. Then the tragedy occurred. I’ve told you all I know\\nmyself now, for the rest is mere surmise and conjecture. We have a good\\nworking basis, however, on which to start. We must hurry up, for I want\\nto go to Halle’s concert to hear Norman Neruda this afternoon.”\\n\\nThis conversation had occurred while our cab had been threading its way\\nthrough a long succession of dingy streets and dreary by-ways. In the\\ndingiest and dreariest of them our driver suddenly came to a stand.\\n“That’s Audley Court in there,” he said, pointing to a narrow slit in\\nthe line of dead-coloured brick. “You’ll find me here when you come\\nback.”\\n\\nAudley Court was not an attractive locality. The narrow passage led us\\ninto a quadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings. We\\npicked our way among groups of dirty children, and through lines of\\ndiscoloured linen, until we came to Number 46, the door of which was\\ndecorated with a small slip of brass on which the name Rance was\\nengraved. On enquiry we found that the constable was in bed, and we\\nwere shown into a little front parlour to await his coming.\\n\\nHe appeared presently, looking a little irritable at being disturbed in\\nhis slumbers. “I made my report at the office,” he said.\\n\\nHolmes took a half-sovereign from his pocket and played with it\\npensively. “We thought that we should like to hear it all from your own\\nlips,” he said.\\n\\n“I shall be most happy to tell you anything I can,” the constable\\nanswered with his eyes upon the little golden disk.\\n\\n“Just let us hear it all in your own way as it occurred.”\\n\\nRance sat down on the horsehair sofa, and knitted his brows as though\\ndetermined not to omit anything in his narrative.\\n\\n“I’ll tell it ye from the beginning,” he said. “My time is from ten at\\nnight to six in the morning. At eleven there was a fight at the ‘White\\nHart’; but bar that all was quiet enough on the beat. At one o’clock it\\nbegan to rain, and I met Harry Murcher—him who has the Holland Grove\\nbeat—and we stood together at the corner of Henrietta Street a-talkin’.\\nPresently—maybe about two or a little after—I thought I would take a\\nlook round and see that all was right down the Brixton Road. It was\\nprecious dirty and lonely. Not a soul did I meet all the way down,\\nthough a cab or two went past me. I was a strollin’ down, thinkin’\\nbetween ourselves how uncommon handy a four of gin hot would be, when\\nsuddenly the glint of a light caught my eye in the window of that same\\nhouse. Now, I knew that them two houses in Lauriston Gardens was empty\\non account of him that owns them who won’t have the drains seen to,\\nthough the very last tenant what lived in one of them died o’ typhoid\\nfever. I was knocked all in a heap therefore at seeing a light in the\\nwindow, and I suspected as something was wrong. When I got to the\\ndoor——”\\n\\n“You stopped, and then walked back to the garden gate,” my companion\\ninterrupted. “What did you do that for?”\\n\\nRance gave a violent jump, and stared at Sherlock Holmes with the\\nutmost amazement upon his features.\\n\\n“Why, that’s true, sir,” he said; “though how you come to know it,\\nHeaven only knows. Ye see, when I got up to the door it was so still\\nand so lonesome, that I thought I’d be none the worse for some one with\\nme. I ain’t afeared of anything on this side o’ the grave; but I\\nthought that maybe it was him that died o’ the typhoid inspecting the\\ndrains what killed him. The thought gave me a kind o’ turn, and I\\nwalked back to the gate to see if I could see Murcher’s lantern, but\\nthere wasn’t no sign of him nor of anyone else.”\\n\\n“There was no one in the street?”\\n\\n“Not a livin’ soul, sir, nor as much as a dog. Then I pulled myself\\ntogether and went back and pushed the door open. All was quiet inside,\\nso I went into the room where the light was a-burnin’. There was a\\ncandle flickerin’ on the mantelpiece—a red wax one—and by its light I\\nsaw——”\\n\\n“Yes, I know all that you saw. You walked round the room several times,\\nand you knelt down by the body, and then you walked through and tried\\nthe kitchen door, and then——”\\n\\nJohn Rance sprang to his feet with a frightened face and suspicion in\\nhis eyes. “Where was you hid to see all that?” he cried. “It seems to\\nme that you knows a deal more than you should.”\\n\\nHolmes laughed and threw his card across the table to the constable.\\n“Don’t get arresting me for the murder,” he said. “I am one of the\\nhounds and not the wolf; Mr. Gregson or Mr. Lestrade will answer for\\nthat. Go on, though. What did you do next?”\\n\\nRance resumed his seat, without however losing his mystified\\nexpression. “I went back to the gate and sounded my whistle. That\\nbrought Murcher and two more to the spot.”\\n\\n“Was the street empty then?”\\n\\n“Well, it was, as far as anybody that could be of any good goes.”\\n\\n“What do you mean?”\\n\\nThe constable’s features broadened into a grin. “I’ve seen many a drunk\\nchap in my time,” he said, “but never anyone so cryin’ drunk as that\\ncove. He was at the gate when I came out, a-leanin’ up agin the\\nrailings, and a-singin’ at the pitch o’ his lungs about Columbine’s\\nNew-fangled Banner, or some such stuff. He couldn’t stand, far less\\nhelp.”\\n\\n“What sort of a man was he?” asked Sherlock Holmes.\\n\\nJohn Rance appeared to be somewhat irritated at this digression. “He\\nwas an uncommon drunk sort o’ man,” he said. “He’d ha’ found hisself in\\nthe station if we hadn’t been so took up.”\\n\\n“His face—his dress—didn’t you notice them?” Holmes broke in\\nimpatiently.\\n\\n“I should think I did notice them, seeing that I had to prop him up—me\\nand Murcher between us. He was a long chap, with a red face, the lower\\npart muffled round——”\\n\\n“That will do,” cried Holmes. “What became of him?”\\n\\n“We’d enough to do without lookin’ after him,” the policeman said, in\\nan aggrieved voice. “I’ll wager he found his way home all right.”\\n\\n“How was he dressed?”\\n\\n“A brown overcoat.”\\n\\n“Had he a whip in his hand?”\\n\\n“A whip—no.”\\n\\n“He must have left it behind,” muttered my companion. “You didn’t\\nhappen to see or hear a cab after that?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“There’s a half-sovereign for you,” my companion said, standing up and\\ntaking his hat. “I am afraid, Rance, that you will never rise in the\\nforce. That head of yours should be for use as well as ornament. You\\nmight have gained your sergeant’s stripes last night. The man whom you\\nheld in your hands is the man who holds the clue of this mystery, and\\nwhom we are seeking. There is no use of arguing about it now; I tell\\nyou that it is so. Come along, Doctor.”\\n\\nWe started off for the cab together, leaving our informant incredulous,\\nbut obviously uncomfortable.\\n\\n“The blundering fool,” Holmes said, bitterly, as we drove back to our\\nlodgings. “Just to think of his having such an incomparable bit of good\\nluck, and not taking advantage of it.”\\n\\n“I am rather in the dark still. It is true that the description of this\\nman tallies with your idea of the second party in this mystery. But why\\nshould he come back to the house after leaving it? That is not the way\\nof criminals.”\\n\\n“The ring, man, the ring: that was what he came back for. If we have no\\nother way of catching him, we can always bait our line with the ring. I\\nshall have him, Doctor—I’ll lay you two to one that I have him. I must\\nthank you for it all. I might not have gone but for you, and so have\\nmissed the finest study I ever came across: a study in scarlet, eh? Why\\nshouldn’t we use a little art jargon. There’s the scarlet thread of\\nmurder running through the colourless skein of life, and our duty is to\\nunravel it, and isolate it, and expose every inch of it. And now for\\nlunch, and then for Norman Neruda. Her attack and her bowing are\\nsplendid. What’s that little thing of Chopin’s she plays so\\nmagnificently: Tra-la-la-lira-lira-lay.”\\n\\nLeaning back in the cab, this amateur bloodhound carolled away like a\\nlark while I meditated upon the many-sidedness of the human mind.'\n",
      "'CHAPTER V.\\nOUR ADVERTISEMENT BRINGS A VISITOR.\\n\\n\\nOur morning’s exertions had been too much for my weak health, and I was\\ntired out in the afternoon. After Holmes’ departure for the concert, I\\nlay down upon the sofa and endeavoured to get a couple of hours’ sleep.\\nIt was a useless attempt. My mind had been too much excited by all that\\nhad occurred, and the strangest fancies and surmises crowded into it.\\nEvery time that I closed my eyes I saw before me the distorted\\nbaboon-like countenance of the murdered man. So sinister was the\\nimpression which that face had produced upon me that I found it\\ndifficult to feel anything but gratitude for him who had removed its\\nowner from the world. If ever human features bespoke vice of the most\\nmalignant type, they were certainly those of Enoch J. Drebber, of\\nCleveland. Still I recognized that justice must be done, and that the\\ndepravity of the victim was no condonement in the eyes of the law.\\n\\nThe more I thought of it the more extraordinary did my companion’s\\nhypothesis, that the man had been poisoned, appear. I remembered how he\\nhad sniffed his lips, and had no doubt that he had detected something\\nwhich had given rise to the idea. Then, again, if not poison, what had\\ncaused the man’s death, since there was neither wound nor marks of\\nstrangulation? But, on the other hand, whose blood was that which lay\\nso thickly upon the floor? There were no signs of a struggle, nor had\\nthe victim any weapon with which he might have wounded an antagonist.\\nAs long as all these questions were unsolved, I felt that sleep would\\nbe no easy matter, either for Holmes or myself. His quiet\\nself-confident manner convinced me that he had already formed a theory\\nwhich explained all the facts, though what it was I could not for an\\ninstant conjecture.\\n\\nHe was very late in returning—so late, that I knew that the concert\\ncould not have detained him all the time. Dinner was on the table\\nbefore he appeared.\\n\\n“It was magnificent,” he said, as he took his seat. “Do you remember\\nwhat Darwin says about music? He claims that the power of producing and\\nappreciating it existed among the human race long before the power of\\nspeech was arrived at. Perhaps that is why we are so subtly influenced\\nby it. There are vague memories in our souls of those misty centuries\\nwhen the world was in its childhood.”\\n\\n“That’s rather a broad idea,” I remarked.\\n\\n“One’s ideas must be as broad as Nature if they are to interpret\\nNature,” he answered. “What’s the matter? You’re not looking quite\\nyourself. This Brixton Road affair has upset you.”\\n\\n“To tell the truth, it has,” I said. “I ought to be more case-hardened\\nafter my Afghan experiences. I saw my own comrades hacked to pieces at\\nMaiwand without losing my nerve.”\\n\\n“I can understand. There is a mystery about this which stimulates the\\nimagination; where there is no imagination there is no horror. Have you\\nseen the evening paper?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“It gives a fairly good account of the affair. It does not mention the\\nfact that when the man was raised up, a woman’s wedding ring fell upon\\nthe floor. It is just as well it does not.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“Look at this advertisement,” he answered. “I had one sent to every\\npaper this morning immediately after the affair.”\\n\\nHe threw the paper across to me and I glanced at the place indicated.\\nIt was the first announcement in the “Found” column. “In Brixton Road,\\nthis morning,” it ran, “a plain gold wedding ring, found in the roadway\\nbetween the ‘White Hart’ Tavern and Holland Grove. Apply Dr. Watson,\\n221B, Baker Street, between eight and nine this evening.”\\n\\n“Excuse my using your name,” he said. “If I used my own some of these\\ndunderheads would recognize it, and want to meddle in the affair.”\\n\\n“That is all right,” I answered. “But supposing anyone applies, I have\\nno ring.”\\n\\n“Oh yes, you have,” said he, handing me one. “This will do very well.\\nIt is almost a facsimile.”\\n\\n“And who do you expect will answer this advertisement.”\\n\\n“Why, the man in the brown coat—our florid friend with the square toes.\\nIf he does not come himself he will send an accomplice.”\\n\\n“Would he not consider it as too dangerous?”\\n\\n“Not at all. If my view of the case is correct, and I have every reason\\nto believe that it is, this man would rather risk anything than lose\\nthe ring. According to my notion he dropped it while stooping over\\nDrebber’s body, and did not miss it at the time. After leaving the\\nhouse he discovered his loss and hurried back, but found the police\\nalready in possession, owing to his own folly in leaving the candle\\nburning. He had to pretend to be drunk in order to allay the suspicions\\nwhich might have been aroused by his appearance at the gate. Now put\\nyourself in that man’s place. On thinking the matter over, it must have\\noccurred to him that it was possible that he had lost the ring in the\\nroad after leaving the house. What would he do, then? He would eagerly\\nlook out for the evening papers in the hope of seeing it among the\\narticles found. His eye, of course, would light upon this. He would be\\noverjoyed. Why should he fear a trap? There would be no reason in his\\neyes why the finding of the ring should be connected with the murder.\\nHe would come. He will come. You shall see him within an hour?”\\n\\n“And then?” I asked.\\n\\n“Oh, you can leave me to deal with him then. Have you any arms?”\\n\\n“I have my old service revolver and a few cartridges.”\\n\\n“You had better clean it and load it. He will be a desperate man, and\\nthough I shall take him unawares, it is as well to be ready for\\nanything.”\\n\\nI went to my bedroom and followed his advice. When I returned with the\\npistol the table had been cleared, and Holmes was engaged in his\\nfavourite occupation of scraping upon his violin.\\n\\n“The plot thickens,” he said, as I entered; “I have just had an answer\\nto my American telegram. My view of the case is the correct one.”\\n\\n“And that is?” I asked eagerly.\\n\\n“My fiddle would be the better for new strings,” he remarked. “Put your\\npistol in your pocket. When the fellow comes speak to him in an\\nordinary way. Leave the rest to me. Don’t frighten him by looking at\\nhim too hard.”\\n\\n“It is eight o’clock now,” I said, glancing at my watch.\\n\\n“Yes. He will probably be here in a few minutes. Open the door\\nslightly. That will do. Now put the key on the inside. Thank you! This\\nis a queer old book I picked up at a stall yesterday—‘De Jure inter\\nGentes’—published in Latin at Liege in the Lowlands, in 1642. Charles’\\nhead was still firm on his shoulders when this little brown-backed\\nvolume was struck off.”\\n\\n“Who is the printer?”\\n\\n“Philippe de Croy, whoever he may have been. On the fly-leaf, in very\\nfaded ink, is written ‘Ex libris Guliolmi Whyte.’ I wonder who William\\nWhyte was. Some pragmatical seventeenth century lawyer, I suppose. His\\nwriting has a legal twist about it. Here comes our man, I think.”\\n\\nAs he spoke there was a sharp ring at the bell. Sherlock Holmes rose\\nsoftly and moved his chair in the direction of the door. We heard the\\nservant pass along the hall, and the sharp click of the latch as she\\nopened it.\\n\\n“Does Dr. Watson live here?” asked a clear but rather harsh voice. We\\ncould not hear the servant’s reply, but the door closed, and some one\\nbegan to ascend the stairs. The footfall was an uncertain and shuffling\\none. A look of surprise passed over the face of my companion as he\\nlistened to it. It came slowly along the passage, and there was a\\nfeeble tap at the door.\\n\\n“Come in,” I cried.\\n\\nAt my summons, instead of the man of violence whom we expected, a very\\nold and wrinkled woman hobbled into the apartment. She appeared to be\\ndazzled by the sudden blaze of light, and after dropping a curtsey, she\\nstood blinking at us with her bleared eyes and fumbling in her pocket\\nwith nervous, shaky fingers. I glanced at my companion, and his face\\nhad assumed such a disconsolate expression that it was all I could do\\nto keep my countenance.\\n\\nThe old crone drew out an evening paper, and pointed at our\\nadvertisement. “It’s this as has brought me, good gentlemen,” she said,\\ndropping another curtsey; “a gold wedding ring in the Brixton Road. It\\nbelongs to my girl Sally, as was married only this time twelvemonth,\\nwhich her husband is steward aboard a Union boat, and what he’d say if\\nhe come ‘ome and found her without her ring is more than I can think,\\nhe being short enough at the best o’ times, but more especially when he\\nhas the drink. If it please you, she went to the circus last night\\nalong with——”\\n\\n“Is that her ring?” I asked.\\n\\n“The Lord be thanked!” cried the old woman; “Sally will be a glad woman\\nthis night. That’s the ring.”\\n\\n“And what may your address be?” I inquired, taking up a pencil.\\n\\n“13, Duncan Street, Houndsditch. A weary way from here.”\\n\\n“The Brixton Road does not lie between any circus and Houndsditch,”\\nsaid Sherlock Holmes sharply.\\n\\nThe old woman faced round and looked keenly at him from her little\\nred-rimmed eyes. “The gentleman asked me for _my_ address,” she said.\\n“Sally lives in lodgings at 3, Mayfield Place, Peckham.”\\n\\n“And your name is——?”\\n\\n“My name is Sawyer—her’s is Dennis, which Tom Dennis married her—and a\\nsmart, clean lad, too, as long as he’s at sea, and no steward in the\\ncompany more thought of; but when on shore, what with the women and\\nwhat with liquor shops——”\\n\\n“Here is your ring, Mrs. Sawyer,” I interrupted, in obedience to a sign\\nfrom my companion; “it clearly belongs to your daughter, and I am glad\\nto be able to restore it to the rightful owner.”\\n\\nWith many mumbled blessings and protestations of gratitude the old\\ncrone packed it away in her pocket, and shuffled off down the stairs.\\nSherlock Holmes sprang to his feet the moment that she was gone and\\nrushed into his room. He returned in a few seconds enveloped in an\\nulster and a cravat. “I’ll follow her,” he said, hurriedly; “she must\\nbe an accomplice, and will lead me to him. Wait up for me.” The hall\\ndoor had hardly slammed behind our visitor before Holmes had descended\\nthe stair. Looking through the window I could see her walking feebly\\nalong the other side, while her pursuer dogged her some little distance\\nbehind. “Either his whole theory is incorrect,” I thought to myself,\\n“or else he will be led now to the heart of the mystery.” There was no\\nneed for him to ask me to wait up for him, for I felt that sleep was\\nimpossible until I heard the result of his adventure.\\n\\nIt was close upon nine when he set out. I had no idea how long he might\\nbe, but I sat stolidly puffing at my pipe and skipping over the pages\\nof Henri Murger’s “Vie de Bohème.” Ten o’clock passed, and I heard the\\nfootsteps of the maid as they pattered off to bed. Eleven, and the more\\nstately tread of the landlady passed my door, bound for the same\\ndestination. It was close upon twelve before I heard the sharp sound of\\nhis latch-key. The instant he entered I saw by his face that he had not\\nbeen successful. Amusement and chagrin seemed to be struggling for the\\nmastery, until the former suddenly carried the day, and he burst into a\\nhearty laugh.\\n\\n“I wouldn’t have the Scotland Yarders know it for the world,” he cried,\\ndropping into his chair; “I have chaffed them so much that they would\\nnever have let me hear the end of it. I can afford to laugh, because I\\nknow that I will be even with them in the long run.”\\n\\n“What is it then?” I asked.\\n\\n“Oh, I don’t mind telling a story against myself. That creature had\\ngone a little way when she began to limp and show every sign of being\\nfoot-sore. Presently she came to a halt, and hailed a four-wheeler\\nwhich was passing. I managed to be close to her so as to hear the\\naddress, but I need not have been so anxious, for she sang it out loud\\nenough to be heard at the other side of the street, ‘Drive to 13,\\nDuncan Street, Houndsditch,’ she cried. This begins to look genuine, I\\nthought, and having seen her safely inside, I perched myself behind.\\nThat’s an art which every detective should be an expert at. Well, away\\nwe rattled, and never drew rein until we reached the street in\\nquestion. I hopped off before we came to the door, and strolled down\\nthe street in an easy, lounging way. I saw the cab pull up. The driver\\njumped down, and I saw him open the door and stand expectantly. Nothing\\ncame out though. When I reached him he was groping about frantically in\\nthe empty cab, and giving vent to the finest assorted collection of\\noaths that ever I listened to. There was no sign or trace of his\\npassenger, and I fear it will be some time before he gets his fare. On\\ninquiring at Number 13 we found that the house belonged to a\\nrespectable paperhanger, named Keswick, and that no one of the name\\neither of Sawyer or Dennis had ever been heard of there.”\\n\\n“You don’t mean to say,” I cried, in amazement, “that that tottering,\\nfeeble old woman was able to get out of the cab while it was in motion,\\nwithout either you or the driver seeing her?”\\n\\n“Old woman be damned!” said Sherlock Holmes, sharply. “We were the old\\nwomen to be so taken in. It must have been a young man, and an active\\none, too, besides being an incomparable actor. The get-up was\\ninimitable. He saw that he was followed, no doubt, and used this means\\nof giving me the slip. It shows that the man we are after is not as\\nlonely as I imagined he was, but has friends who are ready to risk\\nsomething for him. Now, Doctor, you are looking done-up. Take my advice\\nand turn in.”\\n\\nI was certainly feeling very weary, so I obeyed his injunction. I left\\nHolmes seated in front of the smouldering fire, and long into the\\nwatches of the night I heard the low, melancholy wailings of his\\nviolin, and knew that he was still pondering over the strange problem\\nwhich he had set himself to unravel.'\n",
      "'CHAPTER VI.\\nTOBIAS GREGSON SHOWS WHAT HE CAN DO.\\n\\n\\nThe papers next day were full of the “Brixton Mystery,” as they termed\\nit. Each had a long account of the affair, and some had leaders upon it\\nin addition. There was some information in them which was new to me. I\\nstill retain in my scrap-book numerous clippings and extracts bearing\\nupon the case. Here is a condensation of a few of them:—\\n\\nThe _Daily Telegraph_ remarked that in the history of crime there had\\nseldom been a tragedy which presented stranger features. The German\\nname of the victim, the absence of all other motive, and the sinister\\ninscription on the wall, all pointed to its perpetration by political\\nrefugees and revolutionists. The Socialists had many branches in\\nAmerica, and the deceased had, no doubt, infringed their unwritten\\nlaws, and been tracked down by them. After alluding airily to the\\nVehmgericht, aqua tofana, Carbonari, the Marchioness de Brinvilliers,\\nthe Darwinian theory, the principles of Malthus, and the Ratcliff\\nHighway murders, the article concluded by admonishing the Government\\nand advocating a closer watch over foreigners in England.\\n\\nThe _Standard_ commented upon the fact that lawless outrages of the\\nsort usually occurred under a Liberal Administration. They arose from\\nthe unsettling of the minds of the masses, and the consequent weakening\\nof all authority. The deceased was an American gentleman who had been\\nresiding for some weeks in the Metropolis. He had stayed at the\\nboarding-house of Madame Charpentier, in Torquay Terrace, Camberwell.\\nHe was accompanied in his travels by his private secretary, Mr. Joseph\\nStangerson. The two bade adieu to their landlady upon Tuesday, the 4th\\ninst., and departed to Euston Station with the avowed intention of\\ncatching the Liverpool express. They were afterwards seen together upon\\nthe platform. Nothing more is known of them until Mr. Drebber’s body\\nwas, as recorded, discovered in an empty house in the Brixton Road,\\nmany miles from Euston. How he came there, or how he met his fate, are\\nquestions which are still involved in mystery. Nothing is known of the\\nwhereabouts of Stangerson. We are glad to learn that Mr. Lestrade and\\nMr. Gregson, of Scotland Yard, are both engaged upon the case, and it\\nis confidently anticipated that these well-known officers will speedily\\nthrow light upon the matter.\\n\\nThe _Daily News_ observed that there was no doubt as to the crime being\\na political one. The despotism and hatred of Liberalism which animated\\nthe Continental Governments had had the effect of driving to our shores\\na number of men who might have made excellent citizens were they not\\nsoured by the recollection of all that they had undergone. Among these\\nmen there was a stringent code of honour, any infringement of which was\\npunished by death. Every effort should be made to find the secretary,\\nStangerson, and to ascertain some particulars of the habits of the\\ndeceased. A great step had been gained by the discovery of the address\\nof the house at which he had boarded—a result which was entirely due to\\nthe acuteness and energy of Mr. Gregson of Scotland Yard.\\n\\nSherlock Holmes and I read these notices over together at breakfast,\\nand they appeared to afford him considerable amusement.\\n\\n“I told you that, whatever happened, Lestrade and Gregson would be sure\\nto score.”\\n\\n“That depends on how it turns out.”\\n\\n“Oh, bless you, it doesn’t matter in the least. If the man is caught,\\nit will be _on account_ of their exertions; if he escapes, it will be\\n_in spite_ of their exertions. It’s heads I win and tails you lose.\\nWhatever they do, they will have followers. ‘Un sot trouve toujours un\\nplus sot qui l’admire.’”\\n\\n“What on earth is this?” I cried, for at this moment there came the\\npattering of many steps in the hall and on the stairs, accompanied by\\naudible expressions of disgust upon the part of our landlady.\\n\\n“It’s the Baker Street division of the detective police force,” said my\\ncompanion, gravely; and as he spoke there rushed into the room half a\\ndozen of the dirtiest and most ragged street Arabs that ever I clapped\\neyes on.\\n\\n“‘Tention!” cried Holmes, in a sharp tone, and the six dirty little\\nscoundrels stood in a line like so many disreputable statuettes. “In\\nfuture you shall send up Wiggins alone to report, and the rest of you\\nmust wait in the street. Have you found it, Wiggins?”\\n\\n“No, sir, we hain’t,” said one of the youths.\\n\\n“I hardly expected you would. You must keep on until you do. Here are\\nyour wages.” He handed each of them a shilling.\\n\\n“Now, off you go, and come back with a better report next time.”\\n\\nHe waved his hand, and they scampered away downstairs like so many\\nrats, and we heard their shrill voices next moment in the street.\\n\\n“There’s more work to be got out of one of those little beggars than\\nout of a dozen of the force,” Holmes remarked. “The mere sight of an\\nofficial-looking person seals men’s lips. These youngsters, however, go\\neverywhere and hear everything. They are as sharp as needles, too; all\\nthey want is organisation.”\\n\\n“Is it on this Brixton case that you are employing them?” I asked.\\n\\n“Yes; there is a point which I wish to ascertain. It is merely a matter\\nof time. Hullo! we are going to hear some news now with a vengeance!\\nHere is Gregson coming down the road with beatitude written upon every\\nfeature of his face. Bound for us, I know. Yes, he is stopping. There\\nhe is!”\\n\\nThere was a violent peal at the bell, and in a few seconds the\\nfair-haired detective came up the stairs, three steps at a time, and\\nburst into our sitting-room.\\n\\n“My dear fellow,” he cried, wringing Holmes’ unresponsive hand,\\n“congratulate me! I have made the whole thing as clear as day.”\\n\\nA shade of anxiety seemed to me to cross my companion’s expressive\\nface.\\n\\n“Do you mean that you are on the right track?” he asked.\\n\\n“The right track! Why, sir, we have the man under lock and key.”\\n\\n“And his name is?”\\n\\n“Arthur Charpentier, sub-lieutenant in Her Majesty’s navy,” cried\\nGregson, pompously, rubbing his fat hands and inflating his chest.\\n\\nSherlock Holmes gave a sigh of relief, and relaxed into a smile.\\n\\n“Take a seat, and try one of these cigars,” he said. “We are anxious to\\nknow how you managed it. Will you have some whiskey and water?”\\n\\n“I don’t mind if I do,” the detective answered. “The tremendous\\nexertions which I have gone through during the last day or two have\\nworn me out. Not so much bodily exertion, you understand, as the strain\\nupon the mind. You will appreciate that, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for we\\nare both brain-workers.”\\n\\n“You do me too much honour,” said Holmes, gravely. “Let us hear how you\\narrived at this most gratifying result.”\\n\\nThe detective seated himself in the arm-chair, and puffed complacently\\nat his cigar. Then suddenly he slapped his thigh in a paroxysm of\\namusement.\\n\\n“The fun of it is,” he cried, “that that fool Lestrade, who thinks\\nhimself so smart, has gone off upon the wrong track altogether. He is\\nafter the secretary Stangerson, who had no more to do with the crime\\nthan the babe unborn. I have no doubt that he has caught him by this\\ntime.”\\n\\nThe idea tickled Gregson so much that he laughed until he choked.\\n\\n“And how did you get your clue?”\\n\\n“Ah, I’ll tell you all about it. Of course, Doctor Watson, this is\\nstrictly between ourselves. The first difficulty which we had to\\ncontend with was the finding of this American’s antecedents. Some\\npeople would have waited until their advertisements were answered, or\\nuntil parties came forward and volunteered information. That is not\\nTobias Gregson’s way of going to work. You remember the hat beside the\\ndead man?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Holmes; “by John Underwood and Sons, 129, Camberwell Road.”\\n\\nGregson looked quite crest-fallen.\\n\\n“I had no idea that you noticed that,” he said. “Have you been there?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Ha!” cried Gregson, in a relieved voice; “you should never neglect a\\nchance, however small it may seem.”\\n\\n“To a great mind, nothing is little,” remarked Holmes, sententiously.\\n\\n“Well, I went to Underwood, and asked him if he had sold a hat of that\\nsize and description. He looked over his books, and came on it at once.\\nHe had sent the hat to a Mr. Drebber, residing at Charpentier’s\\nBoarding Establishment, Torquay Terrace. Thus I got at his address.”\\n\\n“Smart—very smart!” murmured Sherlock Holmes.\\n\\n“I next called upon Madame Charpentier,” continued the detective. “I\\nfound her very pale and distressed. Her daughter was in the room,\\ntoo—an uncommonly fine girl she is, too; she was looking red about the\\neyes and her lips trembled as I spoke to her. That didn’t escape my\\nnotice. I began to smell a rat. You know the feeling, Mr. Sherlock\\nHolmes, when you come upon the right scent—a kind of thrill in your\\nnerves. ‘Have you heard of the mysterious death of your late boarder\\nMr. Enoch J. Drebber, of Cleveland?’ I asked.\\n\\n“The mother nodded. She didn’t seem able to get out a word. The\\ndaughter burst into tears. I felt more than ever that these people knew\\nsomething of the matter.\\n\\n“‘At what o’clock did Mr. Drebber leave your house for the train?’ I\\nasked.\\n\\n“‘At eight o’clock,’ she said, gulping in her throat to keep down her\\nagitation. ‘His secretary, Mr. Stangerson, said that there were two\\ntrains—one at 9.15 and one at 11. He was to catch the first.’\\n\\n“‘And was that the last which you saw of him?’\\n\\n“A terrible change came over the woman’s face as I asked the question.\\nHer features turned perfectly livid. It was some seconds before she\\ncould get out the single word ‘Yes’—and when it did come it was in a\\nhusky unnatural tone.\\n\\n“There was silence for a moment, and then the daughter spoke in a calm\\nclear voice.\\n\\n“‘No good can ever come of falsehood, mother,’ she said. ‘Let us be\\nfrank with this gentleman. We _did_ see Mr. Drebber again.’\\n\\n“‘God forgive you!’ cried Madame Charpentier, throwing up her hands and\\nsinking back in her chair. ‘You have murdered your brother.’\\n\\n“‘Arthur would rather that we spoke the truth,’ the girl answered\\nfirmly.\\n\\n“‘You had best tell me all about it now,’ I said. ‘Half-confidences are\\nworse than none. Besides, you do not know how much we know of it.’\\n\\n“‘On your head be it, Alice!’ cried her mother; and then, turning to\\nme, ‘I will tell you all, sir. Do not imagine that my agitation on\\nbehalf of my son arises from any fear lest he should have had a hand in\\nthis terrible affair. He is utterly innocent of it. My dread is,\\nhowever, that in your eyes and in the eyes of others he may appear to\\nbe compromised. That however is surely impossible. His high character,\\nhis profession, his antecedents would all forbid it.’\\n\\n“‘Your best way is to make a clean breast of the facts,’ I answered.\\n‘Depend upon it, if your son is innocent he will be none the worse.’\\n\\n“‘Perhaps, Alice, you had better leave us together,’ she said, and her\\ndaughter withdrew. ‘Now, sir,’ she continued, ‘I had no intention of\\ntelling you all this, but since my poor daughter has disclosed it I\\nhave no alternative. Having once decided to speak, I will tell you all\\nwithout omitting any particular.’\\n\\n“‘It is your wisest course,’ said I.\\n\\n“‘Mr. Drebber has been with us nearly three weeks. He and his\\nsecretary, Mr. Stangerson, had been travelling on the Continent. I\\nnoticed a “Copenhagen” label upon each of their trunks, showing that\\nthat had been their last stopping place. Stangerson was a quiet\\nreserved man, but his employer, I am sorry to say, was far otherwise.\\nHe was coarse in his habits and brutish in his ways. The very night of\\nhis arrival he became very much the worse for drink, and, indeed, after\\ntwelve o’clock in the day he could hardly ever be said to be sober. His\\nmanners towards the maid-servants were disgustingly free and familiar.\\nWorst of all, he speedily assumed the same attitude towards my\\ndaughter, Alice, and spoke to her more than once in a way which,\\nfortunately, she is too innocent to understand. On one occasion he\\nactually seized her in his arms and embraced her—an outrage which\\ncaused his own secretary to reproach him for his unmanly conduct.’\\n\\n“‘But why did you stand all this,’ I asked. ‘I suppose that you can get\\nrid of your boarders when you wish.’\\n\\n“Mrs. Charpentier blushed at my pertinent question. ‘Would to God that\\nI had given him notice on the very day that he came,’ she said. ‘But it\\nwas a sore temptation. They were paying a pound a day each—fourteen\\npounds a week, and this is the slack season. I am a widow, and my boy\\nin the Navy has cost me much. I grudged to lose the money. I acted for\\nthe best. This last was too much, however, and I gave him notice to\\nleave on account of it. That was the reason of his going.’\\n\\n“‘Well?’\\n\\n“‘My heart grew light when I saw him drive away. My son is on leave\\njust now, but I did not tell him anything of all this, for his temper\\nis violent, and he is passionately fond of his sister. When I closed\\nthe door behind them a load seemed to be lifted from my mind. Alas, in\\nless than an hour there was a ring at the bell, and I learned that Mr.\\nDrebber had returned. He was much excited, and evidently the worse for\\ndrink. He forced his way into the room, where I was sitting with my\\ndaughter, and made some incoherent remark about having missed his\\ntrain. He then turned to Alice, and before my very face, proposed to\\nher that she should fly with him. “You are of age,” he said, “and there\\nis no law to stop you. I have money enough and to spare. Never mind the\\nold girl here, but come along with me now straight away. You shall live\\nlike a princess.” Poor Alice was so frightened that she shrunk away\\nfrom him, but he caught her by the wrist and endeavoured to draw her\\ntowards the door. I screamed, and at that moment my son Arthur came\\ninto the room. What happened then I do not know. I heard oaths and the\\nconfused sounds of a scuffle. I was too terrified to raise my head.\\nWhen I did look up I saw Arthur standing in the doorway laughing, with\\na stick in his hand. “I don’t think that fine fellow will trouble us\\nagain,” he said. “I will just go after him and see what he does with\\nhimself.” With those words he took his hat and started off down the\\nstreet. The next morning we heard of Mr. Drebber’s mysterious death.’\\n\\n“This statement came from Mrs. Charpentier’s lips with many gasps and\\npauses. At times she spoke so low that I could hardly catch the words.\\nI made shorthand notes of all that she said, however, so that there\\nshould be no possibility of a mistake.”\\n\\n“It’s quite exciting,” said Sherlock Holmes, with a yawn. “What\\nhappened next?”\\n\\n“When Mrs. Charpentier paused,” the detective continued, “I saw that\\nthe whole case hung upon one point. Fixing her with my eye in a way\\nwhich I always found effective with women, I asked her at what hour her\\nson returned.\\n\\n“‘I do not know,’ she answered.\\n\\n“‘Not know?’\\n\\n“‘No; he has a latch-key, and he let himself in.’\\n\\n“‘After you went to bed?’\\n\\n“‘Yes.’\\n\\n“‘When did you go to bed?’\\n\\n“‘About eleven.’\\n\\n“‘So your son was gone at least two hours?’\\n\\n“‘Yes.’\\n\\n“‘Possibly four or five?’\\n\\n“‘Yes.’\\n\\n“‘What was he doing during that time?’\\n\\n“‘I do not know,’ she answered, turning white to her very lips.\\n\\n“Of course after that there was nothing more to be done. I found out\\nwhere Lieutenant Charpentier was, took two officers with me, and\\narrested him. When I touched him on the shoulder and warned him to come\\nquietly with us, he answered us as bold as brass, ‘I suppose you are\\narresting me for being concerned in the death of that scoundrel\\nDrebber,’ he said. We had said nothing to him about it, so that his\\nalluding to it had a most suspicious aspect.”\\n\\n“Very,” said Holmes.\\n\\n“He still carried the heavy stick which the mother described him as\\nhaving with him when he followed Drebber. It was a stout oak cudgel.”\\n\\n“What is your theory, then?”\\n\\n“Well, my theory is that he followed Drebber as far as the Brixton\\nRoad. When there, a fresh altercation arose between them, in the course\\nof which Drebber received a blow from the stick, in the pit of the\\nstomach, perhaps, which killed him without leaving any mark. The night\\nwas so wet that no one was about, so Charpentier dragged the body of\\nhis victim into the empty house. As to the candle, and the blood, and\\nthe writing on the wall, and the ring, they may all be so many tricks\\nto throw the police on to the wrong scent.”\\n\\n“Well done!” said Holmes in an encouraging voice. “Really, Gregson, you\\nare getting along. We shall make something of you yet.”\\n\\n“I flatter myself that I have managed it rather neatly,” the detective\\nanswered proudly. “The young man volunteered a statement, in which he\\nsaid that after following Drebber some time, the latter perceived him,\\nand took a cab in order to get away from him. On his way home he met an\\nold shipmate, and took a long walk with him. On being asked where this\\nold shipmate lived, he was unable to give any satisfactory reply. I\\nthink the whole case fits together uncommonly well. What amuses me is\\nto think of Lestrade, who had started off upon the wrong scent. I am\\nafraid he won’t make much of it. Why, by Jove, here’s the very man\\nhimself!”\\n\\nIt was indeed Lestrade, who had ascended the stairs while we were\\ntalking, and who now entered the room. The assurance and jauntiness\\nwhich generally marked his demeanour and dress were, however, wanting.\\nHis face was disturbed and troubled, while his clothes were disarranged\\nand untidy. He had evidently come with the intention of consulting with\\nSherlock Holmes, for on perceiving his colleague he appeared to be\\nembarrassed and put out. He stood in the centre of the room, fumbling\\nnervously with his hat and uncertain what to do. “This is a most\\nextraordinary case,” he said at last—“a most incomprehensible affair.”\\n\\n“Ah, you find it so, Mr. Lestrade!” cried Gregson, triumphantly. “I\\nthought you would come to that conclusion. Have you managed to find the\\nSecretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson?”\\n\\n“The Secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson,” said Lestrade gravely, “was\\nmurdered at Halliday’s Private Hotel about six o’clock this morning.”'\n"

      "'In the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the\\nUniversity of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course\\nprescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there,\\nI was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant\\nSurgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before I\\ncould join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at\\nBombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and\\nwas already deep in the enemy’s country. I followed, however, with many\\nother officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded\\nin reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once\\nentered upon my new duties.\\n\\nThe campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had\\nnothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and\\nattached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of\\nMaiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which\\nshattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should have\\nfallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the\\ndevotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a\\npack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.\\n\\nWorn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had\\nundergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to\\nthe base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improved\\nso far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little\\nupon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse\\nof our Indian possessions. For months my life was despaired of, and\\nwhen at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak\\nand emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be\\nlost in sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in\\nthe troopship “Orontes,” and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty,\\nwith my health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a\\npaternal government to spend the next nine months in attempting to\\nimprove it.\\n\\nI had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as\\nair—or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will\\npermit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to\\nLondon, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of\\nthe Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time at a\\nprivate hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless\\nexistence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely\\nthan I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances become, that I\\nsoon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate\\nsomewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in\\nmy style of living. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making\\nup my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less\\npretentious and less expensive domicile.\\n\\nOn the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at\\nthe Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning\\nround I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at\\nBarts. The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London\\nis a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In old days Stamford had\\nnever been a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with\\nenthusiasm, and he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me. In\\nthe exuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn,\\nand we started off together in a hansom.\\n\\n“Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?” he asked in\\nundisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets.\\n“You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.”\\n\\nI gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded it\\nby the time that we reached our destination.\\n\\n“Poor devil!” he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my\\nmisfortunes. “What are you up to now?”\\n\\n“Looking for lodgings,” I answered. “Trying to solve the problem as to\\nwhether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable price.”\\n\\n“That’s a strange thing,” remarked my companion; “you are the second\\nman to-day that has used that expression to me.”\\n\\n“And who was the first?” I asked.\\n\\n“A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital.\\nHe was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone\\nto go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found, and which\\nwere too much for his purse.”\\n\\n“By Jove!” I cried, “if he really wants someone to share the rooms and\\nthe expense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a\\npartner to being alone.”\\n\\nYoung Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass. “You\\ndon’t know Sherlock Holmes yet,” he said; “perhaps you would not care\\nfor him as a constant companion.”\\n\\n“Why, what is there against him?”\\n\\n“Oh, I didn’t say there was anything against him. He is a little queer\\nin his ideas—an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as I\\nknow he is a decent fellow enough.”\\n\\n“A medical student, I suppose?” said I.\\n\\n“No—I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is well\\nup in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I know,\\nhe has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His studies are\\nvery desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the\\nway knowledge which would astonish his professors.”\\n\\n“Did you never ask him what he was going in for?” I asked.\\n\\n“No; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be\\ncommunicative enough when the fancy seizes him.”\\n\\n“I should like to meet him,” I said. “If I am to lodge with anyone, I\\nshould prefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strong\\nenough yet to stand much noise or excitement. I had enough of both in\\nAfghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence. How\\ncould I meet this friend of yours?”\\n\\n“He is sure to be at the laboratory,” returned my companion. “He either\\navoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from morning to\\nnight. If you like, we shall drive round together after luncheon.”\\n\\n“Certainly,” I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other\\nchannels.\\n\\nAs we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn, Stamford\\ngave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to\\ntake as a fellow-lodger.\\n\\n“You mustn’t blame me if you don’t get on with him,” he said; “I know\\nnothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally\\nin the laboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold\\nme responsible.”\\n\\n“If we don’t get on it will be easy to part company,” I answered. “It\\nseems to me, Stamford,” I added, looking hard at my companion, “that\\nyou have some reason for washing your hands of the matter. Is this\\nfellow’s temper so formidable, or what is it? Don’t be mealy-mouthed\\nabout it.”\\n\\n“It is not easy to express the inexpressible,” he answered with a\\nlaugh. “Holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes—it approaches\\nto cold-bloodedness. I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch\\nof the latest vegetable alkaloid, not out of malevolence, you\\nunderstand, but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an\\naccurate idea of the effects. To do him justice, I think that he would\\ntake it himself with the same readiness. He appears to have a passion\\nfor definite and exact knowledge.”\\n\\n“Very right too.”\\n\\n“Yes, but it may be pushed to excess. When it comes to beating the\\nsubjects in the dissecting-rooms with a stick, it is certainly taking\\nrather a bizarre shape.”\\n\\n“Beating the subjects!”\\n\\n“Yes, to verify how far bruises may be produced after death. I saw him\\nat it with my own eyes.”\\n\\n“And yet you say he is not a medical student?”\\n\\n“No. Heaven knows what the objects of his studies are. But here we are,\\nand you must form your own impressions about him.” As he spoke, we\\nturned down a narrow lane and passed through a small side-door, which\\nopened into a wing of the great hospital. It was familiar ground to me,\\nand I needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone staircase and\\nmade our way down the long corridor with its vista of whitewashed wall\\nand dun-coloured doors. Near the further end a low arched passage\\nbranched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory.\\n\\nThis was a lofty chamber, lined and littered with countless bottles.\\nBroad, low tables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts,\\ntest-tubes, and little Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering flames.\\nThere was only one student in the room, who was bending over a distant\\ntable absorbed in his work. At the sound of our steps he glanced round\\nand sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure. “I’ve found it! I’ve\\nfound it,” he shouted to my companion, running towards us with a\\ntest-tube in his hand. “I have found a re-agent which is precipitated\\nby hæmoglobin, and by nothing else.” Had he discovered a gold mine,\\ngreater delight could not have shone upon his features.\\n\\n“Dr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” said Stamford, introducing us.\\n\\n“How are you?” he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength for\\nwhich I should hardly have given him credit. “You have been in\\nAfghanistan, I perceive.”\\n\\n“How on earth did you know that?” I asked in astonishment.\\n\\n“Never mind,” said he, chuckling to himself. “The question now is about\\nhæmoglobin. No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of\\nmine?”\\n\\n“It is interesting, chemically, no doubt,” I answered, “but\\npractically——”\\n\\n“Why, man, it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years.\\nDon’t you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains.\\nCome over here now!” He seized me by the coat-sleeve in his eagerness,\\nand drew me over to the table at which he had been working. “Let us\\nhave some fresh blood,” he said, digging a long bodkin into his finger,\\nand drawing off the resulting drop of blood in a chemical pipette.\\n“Now, I add this small quantity of blood to a litre of water. You\\nperceive that the resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water.\\nThe proportion of blood cannot be more than one in a million. I have no\\ndoubt, however, that we shall be able to obtain the characteristic\\nreaction.” As he spoke, he threw into the vessel a few white crystals,\\nand then added some drops of a transparent fluid. In an instant the\\ncontents assumed a dull mahogany colour, and a brownish dust was\\nprecipitated to the bottom of the glass jar.\\n\\n“Ha! ha!” he cried, clapping his hands, and looking as delighted as a\\nchild with a new toy. “What do you think of that?”\\n\\n“It seems to be a very delicate test,” I remarked.\\n\\n“Beautiful! beautiful! The old Guiacum test was very clumsy and\\nuncertain. So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles. The\\nlatter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old. Now, this\\nappears to act as well whether the blood is old or new. Had this test\\nbeen invented, there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who\\nwould long ago have paid the penalty of their crimes.”\\n\\n“Indeed!” I murmured.\\n\\n“Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. A man is\\nsuspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed. His\\nlinen or clothes are examined, and brownish stains discovered upon\\nthem. Are they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit\\nstains, or what are they? That is a question which has puzzled many an\\nexpert, and why? Because there was no reliable test. Now we have the\\nSherlock Holmes’ test, and there will no longer be any difficulty.”\\n\\nHis eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his\\nheart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his\\nimagination.\\n\\n“You are to be congratulated,” I remarked, considerably surprised at\\nhis enthusiasm.\\n\\n“There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year. He would\\ncertainly have been hung had this test been in existence. Then there\\nwas Mason of Bradford, and the notorious Muller, and Lefevre of\\nMontpellier, and Samson of New Orleans. I could name a score of cases\\nin which it would have been decisive.”\\n\\n“You seem to be a walking calendar of crime,” said Stamford with a\\nlaugh. “You might start a paper on those lines. Call it the ‘Police\\nNews of the Past.’”\\n\\n“Very interesting reading it might be made, too,” remarked Sherlock\\nHolmes, sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger.\\n“I have to be careful,” he continued, turning to me with a smile, “for\\nI dabble with poisons a good deal.” He held out his hand as he spoke,\\nand I noticed that it was all mottled over with similar pieces of\\nplaster, and discoloured with strong acids.\\n\\n“We came here on business,” said Stamford, sitting down on a high\\nthree-legged stool, and pushing another one in my direction with his\\nfoot. “My friend here wants to take diggings, and as you were\\ncomplaining that you could get no one to go halves with you, I thought\\nthat I had better bring you together.”\\n\\nSherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms with\\nme. “I have my eye on a suite in Baker Street,” he said, “which would\\nsuit us down to the ground. You don’t mind the smell of strong tobacco,\\nI hope?”\\n\\n“I always smoke ‘ship’s’ myself,” I answered.\\n\\n“That’s good enough. I generally have chemicals about, and occasionally\\ndo experiments. Would that annoy you?”\\n\\n“By no means.”\\n\\n“Let me see—what are my other shortcomings. I get in the dumps at\\ntimes, and don’t open my mouth for days on end. You must not think I am\\nsulky when I do that. Just let me alone, and I’ll soon be right. What\\nhave you to confess now? It’s just as well for two fellows to know the\\nworst of one another before they begin to live together.”\\n\\nI laughed at this cross-examination. “I keep a bull pup,” I said, “and\\nI object to rows because my nerves are shaken, and I get up at all\\nsorts of ungodly hours, and I am extremely lazy. I have another set of\\nvices when I’m well, but those are the principal ones at present.”\\n\\n“Do you include violin-playing in your category of rows?” he asked,\\nanxiously.\\n\\n“It depends on the player,” I answered. “A well-played violin is a\\ntreat for the gods—a badly-played one——”\\n\\n“Oh, that’s all right,” he cried, with a merry laugh. “I think we may\\nconsider the thing as settled—that is, if the rooms are agreeable to\\nyou.”\\n\\n“When shall we see them?”\\n\\n“Call for me here at noon to-morrow, and we’ll go together and settle\\neverything,” he answered.\\n\\n“All right—noon exactly,” said I, shaking his hand.\\n\\nWe left him working among his chemicals, and we walked together towards\\nmy hotel.\\n\\n“By the way,” I asked suddenly, stopping and turning upon Stamford,\\n“how the deuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan?”\\n\\nMy companion smiled an enigmatical smile. “That’s just his little\\npeculiarity,” he said. “A good many people have wanted to know how he\\nfinds things out.”\\n\\n“Oh! a mystery is it?” I cried, rubbing my hands. “This is very\\npiquant. I am much obliged to you for bringing us together. ‘The proper\\nstudy of mankind is man,’ you know.”\\n\\n“You must study him, then,” Stamford said, as he bade me good-bye.\\n“You’ll find him a knotty problem, though. I’ll wager he learns more\\nabout you than you about him. Good-bye.”\\n\\n“Good-bye,” I answered, and strolled on to my hotel, considerably\\ninterested in my new acquaintance.'\n",
      "'CHAPTER II.\\nTHE SCIENCE OF DEDUCTION.'\n",
      "'We met next day as he had arranged, and inspected the rooms at No.\\n221B, Baker Street, of which he had spoken at our meeting. They\\nconsisted of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single large airy\\nsitting-room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad\\nwindows. So desirable in every way were the apartments, and so moderate\\ndid the terms seem when divided between us, that the bargain was\\nconcluded upon the spot, and we at once entered into possession. That\\nvery evening I moved my things round from the hotel, and on the\\nfollowing morning Sherlock Holmes followed me with several boxes and\\nportmanteaus. For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and\\nlaying out our property to the best advantage. That done, we gradually\\nbegan to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new\\nsurroundings.\\n\\nHolmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet in\\nhis ways, and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to be up\\nafter ten at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out\\nbefore I rose in the morning. Sometimes he spent his day at the\\nchemical laboratory, sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and\\noccasionally in long walks, which appeared to take him into the lowest\\nportions of the City. Nothing could exceed his energy when the working\\nfit was upon him; but now and again a reaction would seize him, and for\\ndays on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, hardly\\nuttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night. On these\\noccasions I have noticed such a dreamy, vacant expression in his eyes,\\nthat I might have suspected him of being addicted to the use of some\\nnarcotic, had not the temperance and cleanliness of his whole life\\nforbidden such a notion.\\n\\nAs the weeks went by, my interest in him and my curiosity as to his\\naims in life, gradually deepened and increased. His very person and\\nappearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual\\nobserver. In height he was rather over six feet, and so excessively\\nlean that he seemed to be considerably taller. His eyes were sharp and\\npiercing, save during those intervals of torpor to which I have\\nalluded; and his thin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an air\\nof alertness and decision. His chin, too, had the prominence and\\nsquareness which mark the man of determination. His hands were\\ninvariably blotted with ink and stained with chemicals, yet he was\\npossessed of extraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had\\noccasion to observe when I watched him manipulating his fragile\\nphilosophical instruments.\\n\\nThe reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody, when I confess how\\nmuch this man stimulated my curiosity, and how often I endeavoured to\\nbreak through the reticence which he showed on all that concerned\\nhimself. Before pronouncing judgment, however, be it remembered, how\\nobjectless was my life, and how little there was to engage my\\nattention. My health forbade me from venturing out unless the weather\\nwas exceptionally genial, and I had no friends who would call upon me\\nand break the monotony of my daily existence. Under these\\ncircumstances, I eagerly hailed the little mystery which hung around my\\ncompanion, and spent much of my time in endeavouring to unravel it.\\n\\nHe was not studying medicine. He had himself, in reply to a question,\\nconfirmed Stamford’s opinion upon that point. Neither did he appear to\\nhave pursued any course of reading which might fit him for a degree in\\nscience or any other recognized portal which would give him an entrance\\ninto the learned world. Yet his zeal for certain studies was\\nremarkable, and within eccentric limits his knowledge was so\\nextraordinarily ample and minute that his observations have fairly\\nastounded me. Surely no man would work so hard or attain such precise\\ninformation unless he had some definite end in view. Desultory readers\\nare seldom remarkable for the exactness of their learning. No man\\nburdens his mind with small matters unless he has some very good reason\\nfor doing so.\\n\\nHis ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge. Of contemporary\\nliterature, philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to\\nnothing. Upon my quoting Thomas Carlyle, he inquired in the naivest way\\nwho he might be and what he had done. My surprise reached a climax,\\nhowever, when I found incidentally that he was ignorant of the\\nCopernican Theory and of the composition of the Solar System. That any\\ncivilized human being in this nineteenth century should not be aware\\nthat the earth travelled round the sun appeared to be to me such an\\nextraordinary fact that I could hardly realize it.\\n\\n“You appear to be astonished,” he said, smiling at my expression of\\nsurprise. “Now that I do know it I shall do my best to forget it.”\\n\\n“To forget it!”\\n\\n“You see,” he explained, “I consider that a man’s brain originally is\\nlike a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture\\nas you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he\\ncomes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets\\ncrowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so\\nthat he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skilful\\nworkman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his\\nbrain-attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in\\ndoing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the\\nmost perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has\\nelastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes\\na time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that\\nyou knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to\\nhave useless facts elbowing out the useful ones.”\\n\\n“But the Solar System!” I protested.\\n\\n“What the deuce is it to me?” he interrupted impatiently; “you say that\\nwe go round the sun. If we went round the moon it would not make a\\npennyworth of difference to me or to my work.”\\n\\nI was on the point of asking him what that work might be, but something\\nin his manner showed me that the question would be an unwelcome one. I\\npondered over our short conversation, however, and endeavoured to draw\\nmy deductions from it. He said that he would acquire no knowledge which\\ndid not bear upon his object. Therefore all the knowledge which he\\npossessed was such as would be useful to him. I enumerated in my own\\nmind all the various points upon which he had shown me that he was\\nexceptionally well-informed. I even took a pencil and jotted them down.\\nI could not help smiling at the document when I had completed it. It\\nran in this way—'\n",

      "about Cremona fiddles, and the difference between a Stradivarius and an\n",

      "Number 3, Lauriston Gardens wore an ill-omened and minatory look. It\n",
      "was one of four which stood back some little way from the street, two\n",
      "being occupied and two empty. The latter looked out with three tiers of\n",
      "vacant melancholy windows, which were blank and dreary, save that here\n",
      "and there a “To Let” card had developed like a cataract upon the\n",
      "bleared panes. A small garden sprinkled over with a scattered eruption\n",
      "of sickly plants separated each of these houses from the street, and\n",
      "was traversed by a narrow pathway, yellowish in colour, and consisting\n",
      "apparently of a mixture of clay and of gravel. The whole place was very\n",
      "sloppy from the rain which had fallen through the night. The garden was\n",
      "bounded by a three-foot brick wall with a fringe of wood rails upon the\n",
      "top, and against this wall was leaning a stalwart police constable,\n",
      "surrounded by a small knot of loafers, who craned their necks and\n",
      "strained their eyes in the vain hope of catching some glimpse of the\n",
      "proceedings within.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had imagined that Sherlock Holmes would at once have hurried into the\n",
      "house and plunged into a study of the mystery. Nothing appeared to be\n",
      "further from his intention. With an air of nonchalance which, under the\n",
      "circumstances, seemed to me to border upon affectation, he lounged up\n",
      "and down the pavement, and gazed vacantly at the ground, the sky, the\n",
      "opposite houses and the line of railings. Having finished his scrutiny,\n",
      "he proceeded slowly down the path, or rather down the fringe of grass\n",
      "which flanked the path, keeping his eyes riveted upon the ground. Twice\n",
      "he stopped, and once I saw him smile, and heard him utter an\n",
      "exclamation of satisfaction. There were many marks of footsteps upon\n",
      "the wet clayey soil, but since the police had been coming and going\n",
      "over it, I was unable to see how my companion could hope to learn\n",
      "anything from it. Still I had had such extraordinary evidence of the\n",
      "quickness of his perceptive faculties, that I had no doubt that he\n",
      "could see a great deal which was hidden from me.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the door of the house we were met by a tall, white-faced,\n",
      "flaxen-haired man, with a notebook in his hand, who rushed forward and\n",
      "wrung my companion’s hand with effusion. “It is indeed kind of you to\n",
      "come,” he said, “I have had everything left untouched.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Except that!” my friend answered, pointing at the pathway. “If a herd\n",
      "of buffaloes had passed along there could not be a greater mess. No\n",
      "doubt, however, you had drawn your own conclusions, Gregson, before you\n",
      "permitted this.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have had so much to do inside the house,” the detective said\n",
      "evasively. “My colleague, Mr. Lestrade, is here. I had relied upon him\n",
      "to look after this.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Holmes glanced at me and raised his eyebrows sardonically. “With two\n",
      "such men as yourself and Lestrade upon the ground, there will not be\n",
      "much for a third party to find out,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gregson rubbed his hands in a self-satisfied way. “I think we have done\n",
      "all that can be done,” he answered; “it’s a queer case though, and I\n",
      "knew your taste for such things.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You did not come here in a cab?” asked Sherlock Holmes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nor Lestrade?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then let us go and look at the room.” With which inconsequent remark\n",
      "he strode on into the house, followed by Gregson, whose features\n",
      "expressed his astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "A short passage, bare planked and dusty, led to the kitchen and\n",
      "offices. Two doors opened out of it to the left and to the right. One\n",
      "of these had obviously been closed for many weeks. The other belonged\n",
      "to the dining-room, which was the apartment in which the mysterious\n",
      "affair had occurred. Holmes walked in, and I followed him with that\n",
      "subdued feeling at my heart which the presence of death inspires.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a large square room, looking all the larger from the absence of\n",
      "all furniture. A vulgar flaring paper adorned the walls, but it was\n",
      "blotched in places with mildew, and here and there great strips had\n",
      "become detached and hung down, exposing the yellow plaster beneath.\n",
      "Opposite the door was a showy fireplace, surmounted by a mantelpiece of\n",
      "imitation white marble. On one corner of this was stuck the stump of a\n",
      "red wax candle. The solitary window was so dirty that the light was\n",
      "hazy and uncertain, giving a dull grey tinge to everything, which was\n",
      "intensified by the thick layer of dust which coated the whole\n",
      "apartment.\n",
      "\n",
      "All these details I observed afterwards. At present my attention was\n",
      "centred upon the single grim motionless figure which lay stretched upon\n",
      "the boards, with vacant sightless eyes staring up at the discoloured\n",
      "ceiling. It was that of a man about forty-three or forty-four years of\n",
      "age, middle-sized, broad shouldered, with crisp curling black hair, and\n",
      "a short stubbly beard. He was dressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat\n",
      "and waistcoat, with light-coloured trousers, and immaculate collar and\n",
      "cuffs. A top hat, well brushed and trim, was placed upon the floor\n",
      "beside him. His hands were clenched and his arms thrown abroad, while\n",
      "his lower limbs were interlocked as though his death struggle had been\n",
      "a grievous one. On his rigid face there stood an expression of horror,\n",
      "and as it seemed to me, of hatred, such as I have never seen upon human\n",
      "features. This malignant and terrible contortion, combined with the low\n",
      "forehead, blunt nose, and prognathous jaw gave the dead man a\n",
      "singularly simious and ape-like appearance, which was increased by his\n",
      "writhing, unnatural posture. I have seen death in many forms, but never\n",
      "has it appeared to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark grimy\n",
      "apartment, which looked out upon one of the main arteries of suburban\n",
      "London.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lestrade, lean and ferret-like as ever, was standing by the doorway,\n",
      "and greeted my companion and myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This case will make a stir, sir,” he remarked. “It beats anything I\n",
      "have seen, and I am no chicken.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is no clue?” said Gregson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“None at all,” chimed in Lestrade.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sherlock Holmes approached the body, and, kneeling down, examined it\n",
      "intently. “You are sure that there is no wound?” he asked, pointing to\n",
      "numerous gouts and splashes of blood which lay all round.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Positive!” cried both detectives.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then, of course, this blood belongs to a second individual—presumably\n",
      "the murderer, if murder has been committed. It reminds me of the\n",
      "circumstances attendant on the death of Van Jansen, in Utrecht, in the\n",
      "year ‘34. Do you remember the case, Gregson?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Read it up—you really should. There is nothing new under the sun. It\n",
      "has all been done before.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As he spoke, his nimble fingers were flying here, there, and\n",
      "everywhere, feeling, pressing, unbuttoning, examining, while his eyes\n",
      "wore the same far-away expression which I have already remarked upon.\n",
      "So swiftly was the examination made, that one would hardly have guessed\n",
      "the minuteness with which it was conducted. Finally, he sniffed the\n",
      "dead man’s lips, and then glanced at the soles of his patent leather\n",
      "boots.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He has not been moved at all?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No more than was necessary for the purposes of our examination.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You can take him to the mortuary now,” he said. “There is nothing more\n",
      "to be learned.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Gregson had a stretcher and four men at hand. At his call they entered\n",
      "the room, and the stranger was lifted and carried out. As they raised\n",
      "him, a ring tinkled down and rolled across the floor. Lestrade grabbed\n",
      "it up and stared at it with mystified eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s been a woman here,” he cried. “It’s a woman’s wedding-ring.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He held it out, as he spoke, upon the palm of his hand. We all gathered\n",
      "round him and gazed at it. There could be no doubt that that circlet of\n",
      "plain gold had once adorned the finger of a bride.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This complicates matters,” said Gregson. “Heaven knows, they were\n",
      "complicated enough before.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re sure it doesn’t simplify them?” observed Holmes. “There’s\n",
      "nothing to be learned by staring at it. What did you find in his\n",
      "pockets?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have it all here,” said Gregson, pointing to a litter of objects\n",
      "upon one of the bottom steps of the stairs. “A gold watch, No. 97163,\n",
      "by Barraud, of London. Gold Albert chain, very heavy and solid. Gold\n",
      "ring, with masonic device. Gold pin—bull-dog’s head, with rubies as\n",
      "eyes. Russian leather card-case, with cards of Enoch J. Drebber of\n",
      "Cleveland, corresponding with the E. J. D. upon the linen. No purse,\n",
      "but loose money to the extent of seven pounds thirteen. Pocket edition\n",
      "of Boccaccio’s _Decameron_, with name of Joseph Stangerson upon the\n",
      "fly-leaf. Two letters—one addressed to E. J. Drebber and one to Joseph\n",
      "Stangerson.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“At what address?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“American Exchange, Strand—to be left till called for. They are both\n",
      "from the Guion Steamship Company, and refer to the sailing of their\n",
      "boats from Liverpool. It is clear that this unfortunate man was about\n",
      "to return to New York.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you made any inquiries as to this man, Stangerson?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I did it at once, sir,” said Gregson. “I have had advertisements sent\n",
      "to all the newspapers, and one of my men has gone to the American\n",
      "Exchange, but he has not returned yet.”\n",
      "\n",

      "“How did you word your inquiries?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We simply detailed the circumstances, and said that we should be glad\n",
      "of any information which could help us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You did not ask for particulars on any point which appeared to you to\n",
      "be crucial?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I asked about Stangerson.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing else? Is there no circumstance on which this whole case\n",
      "appears to hinge? Will you not telegraph again?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have said all I have to say,” said Gregson, in an offended voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sherlock Holmes chuckled to himself, and appeared to be about to make\n",
      "some remark, when Lestrade, who had been in the front room while we\n",
      "were holding this conversation in the hall, reappeared upon the scene,\n",
      "rubbing his hands in a pompous and self-satisfied manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Gregson,” he said, “I have just made a discovery of the highest\n",
      "importance, and one which would have been overlooked had I not made a\n",
      "careful examination of the walls.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The little man’s eyes sparkled as he spoke, and he was evidently in a\n",
      "state of suppressed exultation at having scored a point against his\n",
      "colleague.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come here,” he said, bustling back into the room, the atmosphere of\n",
      "which felt clearer since the removal of its ghastly inmate. “Now, stand\n",
      "there!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He struck a match on his boot and held it up against the wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look at that!” he said, triumphantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have remarked that the paper had fallen away in parts. In this\n",
      "particular corner of the room a large piece had peeled off, leaving a\n",
      "yellow square of coarse plastering. Across this bare space there was\n",
      "scrawled in blood-red letters a single word—\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "part 13:\n",
      "RACHE.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "part 14:\n",
      "“What do you think of that?” cried the detective, with the air of a\n",
      "showman exhibiting his show. “This was overlooked because it was in the\n",
      "darkest corner of the room, and no one thought of looking there. The\n",
      "murderer has written it with his or her own blood. See this smear where\n",
      "it has trickled down the wall! That disposes of the idea of suicide\n",
      "anyhow. Why was that corner chosen to write it on? I will tell you. See\n",
      "that candle on the mantelpiece. It was lit at the time, and if it was\n",
      "lit this corner would be the brightest instead of the darkest portion\n",
      "of the wall.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And what does it mean now that you _have_ found it?” asked Gregson in\n",
      "a depreciatory voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mean? Why, it means that the writer was going to put the female name\n",
      "Rachel, but was disturbed before he or she had time to finish. You mark\n",
      "my words, when this case comes to be cleared up you will find that a\n",
      "woman named Rachel has something to do with it. It’s all very well for\n",
      "you to laugh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes. You may be very smart and clever,\n",
      "but the old hound is the best, when all is said and done.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I really beg your pardon!” said my companion, who had ruffled the\n",
      "little man’s temper by bursting into an explosion of laughter. “You\n",
      "certainly have the credit of being the first of us to find this out,\n",
      "and, as you say, it bears every mark of having been written by the\n",
      "other participant in last night’s mystery. I have not had time to\n",
      "examine this room yet, but with your permission I shall do so now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As he spoke, he whipped a tape measure and a large round magnifying\n",
      "glass from his pocket. With these two implements he trotted noiselessly\n",
      "about the room, sometimes stopping, occasionally kneeling, and once\n",
      "lying flat upon his face. So engrossed was he with his occupation that\n",
      "he appeared to have forgotten our presence, for he chattered away to\n",
      "himself under his breath the whole time, keeping up a running fire of\n",
      "exclamations, groans, whistles, and little cries suggestive of\n",
      "encouragement and of hope. As I watched him I was irresistibly reminded\n",
      "of a pure-blooded well-trained foxhound as it dashes backwards and\n",
      "forwards through the covert, whining in its eagerness, until it comes\n",
      "across the lost scent. For twenty minutes or more he continued his\n",
      "researches, measuring with the most exact care the distance between\n",
      "marks which were entirely invisible to me, and occasionally applying\n",
      "his tape to the walls in an equally incomprehensible manner. In one\n",
      "place he gathered up very carefully a little pile of grey dust from the\n",
      "floor, and packed it away in an envelope. Finally, he examined with his\n",
      "glass the word upon the wall, going over every letter of it with the\n",
      "most minute exactness. This done, he appeared to be satisfied, for he\n",
      "replaced his tape and his glass in his pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They say that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains,” he\n",
      "remarked with a smile. “It’s a very bad definition, but it does apply\n",
      "to detective work.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Gregson and Lestrade had watched the manœuvres of their amateur\n",
      "companion with considerable curiosity and some contempt. They evidently\n",
      "failed to appreciate the fact, which I had begun to realize, that\n",
      "Sherlock Holmes’ smallest actions were all directed towards some\n",
      "definite and practical end.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you think of it, sir?” they both asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It would be robbing you of the credit of the case if I was to presume\n",
      "to help you,” remarked my friend. “You are doing so well now that it\n",
      "would be a pity for anyone to interfere.” There was a world of sarcasm\n",
      "in his voice as he spoke. “If you will let me know how your\n",
      "investigations go,” he continued, “I shall be happy to give you any\n",
      "help I can. In the meantime I should like to speak to the constable who\n",
      "found the body. Can you give me his name and address?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lestrade glanced at his note-book. “John Rance,” he said. “He is off\n",
      "duty now. You will find him at 46, Audley Court, Kennington Park Gate.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Holmes took a note of the address.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come along, Doctor,” he said; “we shall go and look him up. I’ll tell\n",
      "you one thing which may help you in the case,” he continued, turning to\n",
      "the two detectives. “There has been murder done, and the murderer was a\n",
      "man. He was more than six feet high, was in the prime of life, had\n",
      "small feet for his height, wore coarse, square-toed boots and smoked a\n",
      "Trichinopoly cigar. He came here with his victim in a four-wheeled cab,\n",
      "which was drawn by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on his\n",
      "off fore leg. In all probability the murderer had a florid face, and\n",
      "the finger-nails of his right hand were remarkably long. These are only\n",
      "a few indications, but they may assist you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lestrade and Gregson glanced at each other with an incredulous smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If this man was murdered, how was it done?” asked the former.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Poison,” said Sherlock Holmes curtly, and strode off. “One other\n",
      "thing, Lestrade,” he added, turning round at the door: “‘Rache,’ is the\n",
      "German for ‘revenge;’ so don’t lose your time looking for Miss Rachel.”\n",

      "'\\n\\n\\nIn the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the\\nUniversity of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course\\nprescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there,\\nI was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant\\nSurgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before I\\ncould join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at\\nBombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and\\nwas already deep in the enemy’s country. I followed, however, with many\\nother officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded\\nin reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once\\nentered upon my new duties.'\n",
      "'\\n\\nThe campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had\\nnothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and\\nattached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of\\nMaiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which\\nshattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should have\\nfallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the\\ndevotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a\\npack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.'\n",
      "'\\n\\nWorn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had\\nundergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to\\nthe base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improved\\nso far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little\\nupon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse\\nof our Indian possessions. For months my life was despaired of, and\\nwhen at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak\\nand emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be\\nlost in sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in\\nthe troopship “Orontes,” and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty,\\nwith my health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a\\npaternal government to spend the next nine months in attempting to\\nimprove it.'\n",
      "'\\n\\nI had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as\\nair—or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will\\npermit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to\\nLondon, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of\\nthe Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time at a\\nprivate hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless\\nexistence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely\\nthan I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances become, that I\\nsoon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate\\nsomewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in\\nmy style of living. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making\\nup my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less\\npretentious and less expensive domicile.'\n",

      "'A STUDY IN SCARLET.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPART I.\\n\\n\\n(_Being a reprint from the Reminiscences of_ JOHN H. WATSON, M.D.,\\n_Late of the Army Medical Department._)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I.\\nMR. SHERLOCK HOLMES.\\n\\n\\nIn the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the\\nUniversity of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course\\nprescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there,\\nI was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant\\nSurgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before I\\ncould join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at\\nBombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and\\nwas already deep in the enemy’s country. I followed, however, with many\\nother officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded\\nin reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once\\nentered upon my new duties.'\n",
      "'The campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had\\nnothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and\\nattached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of\\nMaiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which\\nshattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should have\\nfallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the\\ndevotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a\\npack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.'\n",
      "'Worn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had\\nundergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to\\nthe base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improved\\nso far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little\\nupon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse\\nof our Indian possessions. For months my life was despaired of, and\\nwhen at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak\\nand emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be\\nlost in sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in\\nthe troopship “Orontes,” and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty,\\nwith my health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a\\npaternal government to spend the next nine months in attempting to\\nimprove it.'\n",
      "'I had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as\\nair—or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will\\npermit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to\\nLondon, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of\\nthe Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time at a\\nprivate hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless\\nexistence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely\\nthan I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances become, that I\\nsoon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate\\nsomewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in\\nmy style of living. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making\\nup my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less\\npretentious and less expensive domicile.'\n",
      "'On the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at\\nthe Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning\\nround I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at\\nBarts. The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London\\nis a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In old days Stamford had\\nnever been a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with\\nenthusiasm, and he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me.

      "'“By Jove!” I cried, “if he really wants someone to share the rooms and\\nthe expense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a\\npartner to being alone.”\\n\\nYoung Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass. “You\\ndon’t know Sherlock Holmes yet,” he said; “perhaps you would not care\\nfor him as a constant companion.”\\n\\n“Why, what is there against him?”\\n\\n“Oh, I didn’t say there was anything against him. He is a little queer\\nin his ideas—an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as I\\nknow he is a decent fellow enough.”\\n\\n“A medical student, I suppose?” said I.\\n\\n“No—I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is well\\nup in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I know,\\nhe has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His studies are\\nvery desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the\\nway knowledge which would astonish his professors.”\\n\\n“Did you never ask him what he was going in for?” I asked.'\n",
      "'“Did you never ask him what he was going in for?” I asked.\\n\\n“No; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be\\ncommunicative enough when the fancy seizes him.”\\n\\n“I should like to meet him,” I said. “If I am to lodge with anyone, I\\nshould prefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strong\\nenough yet to stand much noise or excitement. I had enough of both in\\nAfghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence. How\\ncould I meet this friend of yours?”\\n\\n“He is sure to be at the laboratory,” returned my companion. “He either\\navoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from morning to\\nnight. If you like, we shall drive round together after luncheon.”\\n\\n“Certainly,” I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other\\nchannels.\\n\\nAs we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn, Stamford\\ngave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to\\ntake as a fellow-lodger.'\n",

You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold\\nme responsible.”\\n\\n“If we don’t get on it will be easy to part company,” I answered. “It\\nseems to me, Stamford,” I added, looking hard at my companion, “that\\nyou have some reason for washing your hands of the matter.

      "'CHAPTER I.\\nMR. SHERLOCK HOLMES.\\n\\nIn the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the\\nUniversity of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course\\nprescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there,\\nI was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant\\nSurgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before I\\ncould join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at\\nBombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and\\nwas already deep in the enemy’s country. I followed, however, with many\\nother officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded\\nin reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once\\nentered upon my new duties.\\n\\nThe campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had\\nnothing but misfortune and disaster.'\n",

I was removed from my brigade and\\nattached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of\\nMaiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which\\nshattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should have\\nfallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the\\ndevotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a\\npack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.\\n\\nWorn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had\\nundergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to\\nthe base hospital at Peshawar.'\n",

Here I rallied, and had already improved\\nso far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little\\nupon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse\\nof our Indian possessions. For months my life was despaired of, and\\nwhen at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak\\nand emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be\\nlost in sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in\\nthe troopship “Orontes,” and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty,\\nwith my health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a\\npaternal government to spend the next nine months in attempting to\\nimprove it.\\n\\nI had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as\\nair—or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will\\npermit a man to be.'\n",

Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to\\nLondon, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of\\nthe Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time at a\\nprivate hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless\\nexistence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely\\nthan I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances become, that I\\nsoon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate\\nsomewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in\\nmy style of living. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making\\nup my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less\\npretentious and less expensive domicile.\\n\\nOn the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at\\nthe Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning\\nround I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at\\nBarts.'\n",
      "'Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making\\nup my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less\\npretentious and less expensive domicile.\\n\\nOn the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at\\nthe Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning\\nround I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at\\nBarts. The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London\\nis a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In old days Stamford had\\nnever been a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with\\nenthusiasm, and he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me. In\\nthe exuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn,\\nand we started off together in a hansom.\\n\\n“Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?” he asked in\\nundisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets.\\n“You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.”\\n\\nI gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded it\\nby the time that we reached our destination.\\n\\n“Poor devil!” he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my\\nmisfortunes. “What are you up to now?”\\n\\n“Looking for lodgings,” I answered. “Trying to solve the problem as to\\nwhether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable price.”\\n\\n“That’s a strange thing,” remarked my companion; “you are the second\\nman to-day that has used that expression to me.”\\n\\n“And who was the first?” I asked.\\n\\n“A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital.'\n",
      "'“And who was the first?” I asked.\\n\\n“A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital.\\nHe was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone\\nto go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found, and which\\nwere too much for his purse.”\\n\\n“By Jove!” I cried, “if he really wants someone to share the rooms and\\nthe expense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a\\npartner to being alone.”\\n\\nYoung Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass. “You\\ndon’t know Sherlock Holmes yet,” he said; “perhaps you would not care\\nfor him as a constant companion.”\\n\\n“Why, what is there against him?”\\n\\n“Oh, I didn’t say there was anything against him. He is a little queer\\nin his ideas—an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as I\\nknow he is a decent fellow enough.”\\n\\n“A medical student, I suppose?” said I.\\n\\n“No—I have no idea what he intends to go in for.'\n",
